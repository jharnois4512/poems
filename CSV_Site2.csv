Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

I will cover up the mirror with a coat, I don’t want to see<br/>

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

If God is good, how is it that the weed of evil<br/>
takes root everywhere, and what is there to keep us<br/>
from murdering each other in despair? Why is pleasure always<br/>
a prelude to pain? The bartender takes your glasses, tells you<br/>
it’s time to get out. You stumble through the door,<br/>
and there you are in the cold and the wind and a little snow<br/>
that’s started to fall. Two losers stand on a corner.<br/>
One turns to the other and says, Why did our love end?<br/>
The other can’t answer. Why do they torment me? he says.<br/>

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

It’s all\r\n   a fog inside me, refusing to burn off,\r\n\r\nTo offer up the rote responses to the choruses\r\n   of salt testifying to nothing,\r\n\r\nThe nonsense it all comes to like the first\r\n   day of summer and school reports\r\n\r\nFor science torn from my binder and tossed\r\n   onto the winds, so help me.\r\n\r\nNow alone, I see the clouds under sail,\r\n   embarking out there for a port\r\n\r\nWhere the air ends, where all that waits\r\n   for us is the heavy ringing of\r\n\r\nThe sea’s dull bells. Pick any five men\r\n   mumbling in their coast, drifting\r\n\r\nOn the cliff-side benches, an on-shore breeze\r\n   at their unmetaphysical throats\r\n\r\nAnd see how many words of allegiance or joy\r\n   can be squeezed out at this late date.\r\n\r\nMake something of the one palm tree whose green\r\n   fronds are comparatively glorious\r\n\r\nAnd resist the graceless rip and under-tow—\r\n   it’s just that way with God.']"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

to the corner over the scraped sidewalk, slip and fall down hard<br/>
on the ice. Actually a banana peel, but who’s looking?<br/>
Only a priest, a rabbi, and a lawyer you vaguely recognize—<br/>
didn’t she help with the divorce? Never mind, the marraige<br/>
is over, good riddance. You’re thinking now<br/>
you’d better have a double. You get up, holding your hip,<br/>
and limp towards the neon martini glass.<br/>
Anyway a man goes into a bar, just like you do.<br/>
He’s tired of life, tired of being alone. No one<br/>
takes him seriously; at work he’s the butt of jokes,<br/>
the foreman calls him <em>Moron</em> all day long. It’s true<br/>
he’s not too bright. He wants to kill himself,<br/>
but doesn’t know how to. He orders drink after drink,<br/>
cursing the angel who passed out brains.<br/>
You take the stool next to him. In half an hour<br/>
you’re pals—two losers getting shitfaced.<br/>
You start to tell each other riddles. What’s big and red<br/>
and eats rocks; what do you get when you cross a penis<br/>
with a potato? Why is there something rather than nothing?<br/>
If God is good, how is it that the weed of evil<br/>
takes root everywhere, and what is there to keep us<br/>
from murdering each other in despair? Why is pleasure always<br/>
a prelude to pain? The bartender takes your glasses, tells you<br/>
it’s time to get out. You stumble through the door,<br/>
and there you are in the cold and the wind and a little snow<br/>
that’s started to fall. Two losers stand on a corner.<br/>
One turns to the other and says, Why did our love end?<br/>
The other can’t answer. Why do they torment me? he says.<br/>
The snowstorm begins in earnest but still they stand there,<br/>
determined to stay put until they finally get it.</br></br>]"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

It doesn’t devour everything that comes in its way, and it doesn’t like desolate waters any more than the next fish. For thousands of years, it’s patrolled the seams between cold and warm ocean currents and, rather recently, showed the Europeans the way to America. The trouble is the codfish can’t remember a thing. It might swim to Labrador or Lofoton for twenty straight years, and not recognize any of it. On good days, its memory lasts maybe three seconds. Say, is that a herring or a lure? When mistaken, it won’t put up a fight; it won’t even try to slip off the hook. It’s had enough and will throw in the towel. Life’s just not fair. Or is it? The codfish really can’t remember.']"

I will cover up the mirror with a coat, I don’t want to see<br/>

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"

For thousands of years, it’s patrolled the seams between cold and warm ocean currents and, rather recently, showed the Europeans the way to America. The trouble is the codfish can’t remember a thing. It might swim to Labrador or Lofoton for twenty straight years, and not recognize any of it. On good days, its memory lasts maybe three seconds. Say, is that a herring or a lure? When mistaken, it won’t put up a fight; it won’t even try to slip off the hook. It’s had enough and will throw in the towel. Life’s just not fair. Or is it? The codfish really can’t remember.']"

Having survived a life of imprisonment, house arrest and exile, he wrote of love, survival and our common humanity. Now Mahmoud Darwish is no longer among us, this poet who made of his language a homeland, who dwelled in exilic being—this solitary, private man who became the voice of a people, and who, in a language of fig trees, olives and flute music, exile and longing, re-built in poetry the four hundred and seventeen invisible villages of Palestine, such as Al-Birweh—which he was forced to flee as a boy—the village to which his empty, symbolic coffin was carried to be set among the stones of what may have once been his house, near a prickly pear bush, in a dry wind.\xa0 At that same moment in Ramallah, tens of thousands attended his state funeral and laid him to rest on a hillside with Jerusalem visible in the distance.\xa0 Those who carried the second coffin to Al-Birweh knew that their poet had to be buried twice, once for his presence and once for his absence.']"
