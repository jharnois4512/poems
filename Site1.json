His poetry has been translated into German and Danish. Dikson has performed on numerous occasions in Zimbabwe and South Africa including a feature performance at the renowned Poetry Africa Festival. He has also performed in Germany, Norway and Denmark as part of two separate tours. He has collaborated with artists from the US, England, Norway and Botswana and has been a part of jazz-fusion acts, electronic and poetic fusions. He has conducted workshops for disadvantaged youth in Zimbabwe and in schools in South Africa, Norway and Denmark.He is the workshops, conferences and exhibitions manager for Zimbabwe\u2019s fastest growing international festival, Shoko. The focus of the festival is on empowering urban youth and culture by providing a platform for urban art forms and artists. Hip-hop and spoken word is at the nucleus of this festival where local artists collaborate with international artists from around the world. In the past they have had Natty (UK) perform and conduct workshops, Akala (UK) collaborate with local artists and share the similarities between hip-hop and Shakespeare in the workshop programme, Tumi and the Volume (SA) perform and conduct song-writing workshops, amongst many others from Germany, the US, Botswana and Kenya. This involves a close working relationship with international artists and ensuring that their needs are met: the practicalities of transport, accommodation, fees, budgeting and itinerary as well as providing them with ample information, being flexible when it comes to their creative wishes and reliable throughout the tour.Zimbabwe\u2019s most well known festival, HIFA has also recruited the artist and organiser for the last few years as both the Youth Zone consultant and the Workshops and Masterclasses consultant. As the latter he had to create and co-ordinate a programme that included 22 public workshops for adults and youth as well as a master class programme that involved over 30 international artists from Africa, Europe, the US and Australia that spanned the week of the festival. He was responsible for liaising with the artists and finalising the content of each workshop.Dikson placed a heavy emphasis on cultural exchange and created an innovative selection of workshops that were collaboratively run by local and international artists. In this way they were able to fuse different styles and sounds.Dikson is also the editor and creative director of the Zimbabwean youth platform, Kalabash. The website was launched in mid-May of 2013 and has become the country\u2019s leading youth opinion site. His role has been to direct young writers from around the country to come up with content on arts, culture, society and politics. Either in the office or through online correspondence he has mentored and urged them to break the boundaries of archaic writing styles and approaches. Through workshops he has encouraged young contributors to explore different media such as film, audio and photography to capture their Zimbabwe. The site has also been selected as one of the eighteen winners of the World Summit Youth Awards out of over 400 applicants.Aside from this Dikson is also a staff writer for the US-based travel and culture site, Matador.

He spent hours trying to figure out how and when the world changed to colour. He roamed the neighborhood with friends creating strange worlds in empty lots\u2014Cowboys and Indians, Star Wars, Huck Finn. School bored him. He mostly stared out the windows. His head was never where his body was. It still isn\u2019t. His teenage years were spent in Johannesburg. After school, he joined the military for 2 years because it was compulsory and because his family wasn\u2019t rich enough to send him into exile in order to dodge the dictates of the Apartheid regime. At 18 he did a tour of duty in the Angolan War. After his discharge he resolved never to wear a uniform or take up arms again. (so far, so good) He studied acting, moved to Cape Town and became a successful actor. He loved the collaborative nature of acting, all the oddballs and geniuses, and that no two days were the same.  In 1998 he co-founded a professional acting school in Cape Town because he wanted to give something back to the industry that had saved him from the 9-5. By 2002 he was utterly burnt out. His life was burning down around his ears. He felt as if he were sitting in a deck chair with a cold beer watching everything go up in smoke. He quit acting, got divorced, and moved to the UK where he started writing full-time as a means to orient himself on the map. He moved back to Johannesburg in 2010.

so much freedom like she did not know slavery too well </p>, <p>Have you ever seen an African King cry?<br/>\nWatch his tears dance down his cheeks in morbid helplessness<br/>\nGalloping through the

seen and African dance<br/>\nHave you ever looked on in tears, heart skipping with smile and said, \u201cthis is beautiful\u201d<br/>\nThat this grace is worth glancing at twice<br/>\nWhen rain meets a sunny day<br/>\nHow his outro fades like the sun behind the mountains at dusk<br/>\nHow his movements are tears filled praises<br/>\nLimbs telling folktales worthy of the king\u2019s ears<br/>\nTo say that this dance brings our souls before God<br/>\nHow our knees kiss the floor in humility and our hands marry the sky in adoration,<br/>\nand how our hearts pour out its supplication<br/>\nThat in this state of devotion, we find faith, we find flaw, yet a blazing firefly still buzzes within<br/>\nThat we move like there\u2019s a solar flare skipping inside<br/>\nThat we dance because it frees the soul from this shackled flesh<br/>\nWe dance like its our last for our legacies are more genuine when painted on tainted canvas for tomorrow may crumple this page with dementia causing us to forget the heavenly joy that was penned here tonight<br/>\nTo rest in our sleep and wake up anew moving like pain did not sleep here tonight<br/>\nSo the next time you see and AFRICAN dance, pause,

Born in the U.S., his family immigrated from El Salvador during a violent civil war. Growing as a \u201cLatino\u201d in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in America, Javier always came face-to-face with questions surrounding identity, masculinity, class, and heritage.\u00a0As a first generation university student, he studied political science, while quickly developing a passion for spoken-word poetry on the side. With some friends, he started Swarthmore College\u2019s first spoken-word collective, OASIS (Our Art Spoken In Soul), and competed at local and national poetry slam competitions. After graduating, he was awarded the Thomas J Watson Fellowship to travel internationally for a year in pursuit of an independent project: an exploration of how poetry can empower, heal, and give voice to criminalized youths in light of the massive growth of prison systems worldwide. After traveling to South Africa, Australia, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Brazil, Javier concluded two main things: crime and incarceration are global phenomena intimately linked to histories of colonialism, racial violence, and inequality; and poetry provides a transformative space for communities to challenge, reimagine, and change the status quo. He now lives and works in Cape Town as a resident poet for Usiko Trust, facilitating poetry workshops alongside youths from the townships to create a space for exploring their voices and (re)writing their narratives.

She clearly feels very much a part of her audience and believes that in listening incisively they will find twists, turns and whimsies of our collective destiny food for inspired thought.A \u201cproudly Nigerian\u201d poet, vocalist and lyricist with a tender tough stripe of cultural louche and spiritual commentary, Jumi\u2019s artistic style is bold and imaginative with a conversational voice that sounds almost reticent.In Jumi\u2019s Spoken Cabaret, she maximizes this compelling and inimitable style to ride hot currents for the pain and pleasure of swooping around spiritual, pure, social, maternal and fragile subjects. Whilst doing this, she clings to images of reality that are firmly embedded in what she perceives to be the public\u2019s consciousness, acknowledging issues people feel they are familiar with or can relate to, offering a speculative but entirely plausible view.Exposure to Yoruba griot sounds, classical forms of music plus a need for and hunger to express truth\u2019s tale becomes tension released in distinct ways in each of the ten tracks on the CD.

In this poem Justin shares his concerns about the Tanzanian education system. He believes it is designed to keep black people weak and meek, and people should continue sending their children through this system if they do not want them to be strong, independent, and powerful people. The poet says they are not taught about self-confidence, self-valuing, self-education (knowledge of self), health, nutrition, relationships, sex and sexuality. They are not taught how to question and to reason. Justin is advocating for a new education system, one that will instil a sense of pride, teach them about their true history, and redefine the brains of many brainwashed Africans. The education system needs to build a strong people.</p>]"}, {"bio": "<span class=\"dxeBase\" id=\"ContentPlaceHolder_ContentPlaceHolder_BioPanel_BioLabel\" style=\"font-size: 1.116em; white-space: normal;\">Performance poet,\u00a0 Koleka Putuma, is based in Cape Town and currently pursuing a degree in Theatre and Performance at the University of Cape Town.

He is the son of the late Silverton Manikani Nyatsumba and Maria Ntombizodwa Nkambule.Kaizer went to a number of schools \u2013 Entokozweni Primary School at Ngodini (KaBokweni), Lwaleng Primary School outside White River, Ngodwana Primary School, Mshadza Secondary School outside White River and Dlangezwa High School in the Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal area \u2013 before proceeding first to the University of Zululand and later to Georgetown University in Washington DC, USA.He started writing plays, acting in them and directing them when he was still at Ngodwana Primary School, and continued to do the same at Mshadza Secondary School and at Dlangezwa High School. Some of his published poems were written when he was in Standard Seven (Grade Nine) at secondary school, and his first published newspaper article was in the now-defunct KaNgwane Times in Nelspruit when he was in the same grade.A born leader, Kaizer was appointed Deputy Head Prefect at Mshadza Secondary School, Deputy Head Prefect at Dlangezwa High School, Editor of UNICOM at the University of Zululand and Chairman of the University of Zululand chapter of the African Writers\u2019 Association, which he launched. Upon his return to South Africa upon completion of his studies at Georgetown University, he was elected Assistant Secretary of the African Writers\u2019 Association at national level.Kaizer worked for 15 years as a journalist, a profession in which he excelled and rose meteorically to become South Africa\u2019s first African Political Correspondent and first black Political Editor on a formerly white newspaper, The Star in Johannesburg, and the country\u2019s first African Editor when he was appointed founding Editor of The Independent on Saturday in Durban. He also edited the Daily News in that city, before being posted to London, with his family, where he was Associate Editor on The Independent.Kaizer was one of seven South African journalists sent by Independent Newspapers to the Harvard Business School and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University for an intensive, two-month-long Senior Leadership Develop Program in 1996. He is also the only journalist within the Independent Newspapers Group to have been seconded to The Independent in London, then the international flagship within the Irish-owned media group.<br/>\nKaizer left journalism at the end of 2002 and joined Anglo American South Africa in January 2003 as Vice President: Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for marketing. In that capacity, he persuaded Anglo American to back South Africa\u2019s bid for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and represented the company on the Board of the 2010 Bid Company. He travelled to a number of countries \u2013 where Anglo American also had a presence \u2013 with then 2010 Bid Company CEO Danny Jordaan to campaign for South Africa\u2019s bid to host the 2010 World Cup.With Jordaan and then First National Bank Marketing Director Derek Carstens, Kaizer visited Barcelona and Madrid \u2013 where they met Barcelona FC and Real Madrid FC players, including Ronaldinho \u2013 in an attempt to get either one of the Spanish giants to visit South Africa to play against the country\u2019s top teams, Kaizer Chiefs FC and Orlando Pirates FC, as part of the promotion of South Africa\u2019s candidature for the World Cup. They even travelled to Valencia to watch Real Madrid beat Valencia FC 1-0, thanks to Ronaldo\u2019s goal, and flew back to Madrid with the team in its plane.Regrettably, the two Spanish teams could not accommodate a visit to South Africa, thus opening the way for London-based Tottenham Hot Spur to play against Pirates in Durban and Chiefs in Cape Town.Kaizer has also worked for Coca-Cola South Africa as Public Affairs and Communications Director, Sasol Ltd as Group General Manager: Corporate Affairs, Marketing and Black Economic Empowerment, KMN Consulting as Managing Director and PetroSA as Vice-President: Corporate Affairs and Shared Services. He is currently Chief Executive Officer of the Johannesburg-based Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa.A Certified Director (IoDSA), Kaizer holds a BA Honours from Georgetown University, an MBA from the University of Hull, a Post-Graduate Certificate in Economics from the University of the Witwatersrand, an Advanced Management Programme Diploma from the University of Pretoria\u2019s Gordon Institute of Business Science and a Journalism Diploma from the Newspaper Institute of America.

Kokumo\u2019s delivery will obviously draw comparisons to Mutabaruka but there is an originality of style that will appeal to audiences worldwide.Described as not just an artist but also a cultural anthropologist and dub-griot, Kokumo uses his skills as a singer/songwriter and a dub-poet to capture his audience, whilst taking them on a cultural, spiritual and political journey.Hailed from the parish better known as the cockpit country in rural Jamaica, seems to have contributed to the powerful voice that allows his words to take flight.With a name meaning, \u201cthis one will not die\u201d in Yoruba, is synonymous with the notion that his work will be around forever.His work is rooted in the consciousness of Rasta and the cultural experiences of black people worldwide. This consciousness was triggered from an early age which he credited to being around his Rastafarian cousins but didn\u2019t manifest until a later stage in life when he began to write songs and poetry.Kokumo\u2019s multidisciplinary skills as a performer have landed him roles in plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company and his own sold out production, <em>GENESIS 9:25</em> @ The Birmingham Rep.

That\u2019s the caffeine, I attempt to counteract the noise in vain by lighting a cigarette and hoping the nicotine will flow through my veins. No use. This substance has already begun to take a toll, already begun to take control, perhaps cheap alcohol will enable me to let loose. That\u2019s a rich excuse!

Crying, laughing, laughing till you cry, being shy, telling a lie, honesty. Gentle breathing, nervous heaving, Goosebumps that start to run up your spine, orgasms that will blow your mind, words that are sometimes hard to find, stealing a heart, committing a crime, breaking in braking through breaking up. Clumsiness, silliness, being generous. Giving, receiving, taking hugs, kisses, rejection, dismisses. Feeling blessed. Feeling stressed. A calming walk in a forest filled with trees, smell the flowers, the birds and the bees and in all this craziness I am weak in the knees. A soft bottom lip, I stumble over my words. This drug is a trip.</p>, <p>She glides as if she is walking on water, Jesus! I am battling to stay afloat, doubt as sharp as an iceberg enters my mind and I search franticly to find a whistle to blow in this ice cold see, but it\u2019s pointless. This time there is no life boat to come and rescue me.</p>, <p>I become drowsy and start to drown in this drug, overdose on kisses and hugs as they warm my heart. Shrug it off Kyle! Wake up, you are only dipping your toe into a pool, you promised yourself you would never take another drug again in your life. You almost died once. Don\u2019t be a fool!</p>, <p>I have dealt with hits of love before, usually to the gut. Waking up on my bedroom floor six months later eating ice-cream and feeling stuck in a sticky rut. I screamed for love to leave me alone to pass through my system, I have even attempted cold turkey but that bitch won\u2019t listen, so I decided to make it my mission. I began to deal with all sorts of customers, tall, short, rough, and gentle ones to. Betting on people\u2019s lives all for a rand or two, racking in their money and not worrying about the consequences or caring about the damage, as long as I was winning I was always able to manage. Roulette wheeling and blackjack dealing with users, love abusers. Hoping this spin will change their fortune or this hand would make things right. Gambling with their hearts even though they have been losers all their life.</p>, <p>It\u2019s true what they say what goes around comes around, because I have found that when I come round love goes, as well as my obsession. Possession is nine tenths of the law but I have no more breath to possess. I have overdosed on love even after I promised myself no more drugs.</p>, <p>So looking forward.</p>, <p>Perhaps this whole time it has not been the drug, but rather the dealer. My god you should see her!

At the age of sixteen years she and her parents returned to their home country. It was while she was studying law and international relations at Wits University in Johannesburg that the desire to work as an artist took hold of her. In her work as a life skills facilitator for adolescents \u00f1 focusing on topics like gender issues, teamwork and sexuality \u00f1 poetry has been her preferred medium. Mashile regards its expressive power as the most effective tool to bring about those changes in mental attitude that are needed in the aftermath of the socio-political changes in post-apartheid South Africa. \u201cThe enemy isn\u00edt really clear in the way it was before. It\u2019s an incredibly sensitive, complicated struggle with many dimensions, but the site for that struggle is inside. \u2026 The language of poetry comes from a place where that transformation has to begin, that sort of intuitive, creative, spiritual searching place that will be the fuel for any kind of transformation process.\u201dMashile began to achieve recognition as one of South Africa\u2019s most popular young artists in 2002 when she performed her hip-hop inspired poetry at the Urban Voices Spoken Word and Music Festival to a large audience. She was the presenter and producer of the television programme <em>L\u2019Atitude</em>, a concept that she co-executive produced with Curious Pictures. Throughout its three seasons and seventy-eight episodes she introduced the viewers to the personal stories of a diverse cross section of South Africans and their relationships with their immediate surroundings. These insights were gained from her travels through South Africa. The series reached an audience of over two million households.Her lyrical and gutsy poems in the collection <em>A Ribbon of Rhythm</em> (2005) also speak about life in the new South Africa. Issues such as the diversity and unity of the \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d, the status of women, violence and the fragility of individuals are all treated with a sense of urgency, humour and at times with melancholy and a certain rawness. Mashile\u2019s self-produced album<em> Lebo Mashile Live!</em> combines her performance poetry with hip-hop, house and R & B.In June of 2008, Mashile published her second anthology entitled<em> Flying Above the Sky.</em> This collection marks the poet\u2019s first foray into self-publishing. In October of 2008, Mashile wrote and performed in a cross-media and cross-generational collaboration with renowned choreographer Sylvia Glasser entitled <em>Threads</em>. One can find Mashile\u2019s thoughts in her monthly column, <em>In Her Shoes</em>, which she writes for True Love magazine. She can currently be seen on South African television screens as the presenter of <em>Drawing the Line</em>, a game show on SABC2 dealing with moral issues. The show is now in its second season.In 2006 she was awarded the prestigious<em> Noma Award</em> for Publishing in Africa, the premier prize for African literature. The Jury characterised her poetry as of \u201ca distinct oral flavour, developing oral poetry and performance beyond the boundaries of the poetry of the era of resistance\u201d.

She is the current Publicity Manager of Poetry Society-University of Botswana. Her writing and work emanates from the need to shouting the inner voice, speaking untold stories and voicing out stories of the gospel. She started performing poetry at the age of 16, at social celebrations. Her devotion to pen and paper elevated her to new platforms by later reciting weekly at the UB writer\u2019s workshop, Poetry Society Wednesdays, and monthly at \u2018Soul Poetry\u2019 and \u2018Poets Passport\u2019 at Gaborone National Museum.<br/>\nShe has since then performed in poetry events such as the International Women\u2019s day poetry event 2012, hosted by Alliance Francaise, the 1st and 2nd annual Multilingual Poetry Festival in November 2012 and 2013, gracing both events with multilingual poems and a Chinese song.

Born in <a href=\"http://www.dayton.net/dayton/\">Dayton, Ohio</a>, in 1872, Dunbar penned a large body of dialect poems, standard English poems, essays, novels and short stories before he died at the age of 33. His work often addressed the difficulties encountered by members of his race and the efforts of African-Americans to achieve equality in America. He was praised both by the prominent literary critics of his time and his literary contemporaries.Dunbar was born on June 27, 1872, to Matilda and Joshua Dunbar, both natives of Kentucky. His mother was a former slave and his father had escaped from slavery and served in the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and the 5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War. Matilda and Joshua had two children before separating in 1874. Matilda also had two children from a previous marriage.The family was poor, and after Joshua left, Matilda supported her children by working in Dayton as a washerwoman. One of the families she worked for was the family of Orville and Wilbur Wright, with whom her son attended Dayton\u2019s Central High School. Though the Dunbar family had little material wealth, Matilda, always a great support to Dunbar as his literary stature grew, taught her children a love of songs and storytelling. Having heard poems read by the family she worked for when she was a slave, Matilda loved poetry and encouraged her children to read. Dunbar was inspired by his mother, and he began reciting and writing poetry as early as age 6.Dunbar was the only African-American in his class at Dayton Central High, and while he often had difficulty finding employment because of his race, he rose to great heights in school. He was a member of the debating society, editor of the school paper and president of the school\u2019s literary society. He also wrote for Dayton community newspapers. He worked as an elevator operator in Dayton\u2019s Callahan Building until he established himself locally and nationally as a writer. He published an African-American newsletter in Dayton, the <em>Dayton Tattler</em>, with help from the Wright brothers.His first public reading was on his birthday in 1892. A former teacher arranged for him to give the welcoming address to the Western Association of Writers when the organization met in Dayton. James Newton Matthews became a friend of Dunbar\u2019s and wrote to an Illinois paper praising Dunbar\u2019s work. The letter was reprinted in several papers across the country, and the accolade drew regional attention to Dunbar; James Whitcomb Riley, a poet whose works were written almost entirely in dialect, read Matthew\u2019s letter and acquainted himself with Dunbar\u2019s work. With literary figures beginning to take notice, Dunbar decided to publish a book of poems. <em>Oak and Ivy</em>, his first collection, was published in 1892.Though his book was received well locally, Dunbar still had to work as an elevator operator to help pay off his debt to his publisher. He sold his book for a dollar to people who rode the elevator. As more people came in contact with his work, however, his reputation spread. In 1893, he was invited to recite at the World\u2019s Fair, where he met Frederick Douglass, the renowned abolitionist who rose from slavery to political and literary prominence in America. Douglass called Dunbar \u201cthe most promising young colored man in America.\u201dDunbar moved to Toledo, Ohio, in 1895, with help from attorney Charles A. Thatcher and psychiatrist Henry A. Tobey. Both were fans of Dunbar\u2019s work, and they arranged for him to recite his poems at local libraries and literary gatherings. Tobey and Thatcher also funded the publication of Dunbar\u2019s second book, <em>Majors and Minors</em>.It was Dunbar\u2019s second book that propelled him to national fame. William Dean Howells, a novelist and widely respected literary critic who edited <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em>, praised Dunbar\u2019s book in one of his weekly columns and launched Dunbar\u2019s name into the most respected literary circles across the country. A New York publishing firm, Dodd Mead and Co., combined Dunbar\u2019s first two books and published them as <em>Lyrics of a Lowly Life</em>. The book included an introduction written by Howells. In 1897, Dunbar traveled to England to recite his works on the London literary circuit. His national fame had spilled across the Atlantic.After returning from England, Dunbar married Alice Ruth Moore, a young writer, teacher and proponent of racial and gender equality who had a master\u2019s degree from Cornell University. Dunbar took a job at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. He found the work tiresome, however, and it is believed the library\u2019s dust contributed to his worsening case of tuberculosis. He worked there for only a year before quitting to write and recite full time.In 1902, Dunbar and his wife separated. Depression stemming from the end of his marriage and declining health drove him to a dependence on alcohol, which further damaged his health. He continued to write, however. He ultimately produced 12 books of poetry, four books of short stories, a play and five novels. His work appeared in <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em>, the <em>Sunday Evening Post</em>, the <em>Denver Post</em>, <em>Current Literature</em> and a number of other magazines and journals. He traveled to Colorado and visited his half-brother in Chicago before returning to his mother in Dayton in 1904.

This dynamic and groundbreaking move was sparked by her friends who saw \u2018the dirt I made on every paper I laid my hands on\u2019.  These raw squiggles translated as poetry to Priscah\u2019s friends, who urged her to nurture and develop the art form. Thus, Priscah joined the Botswana\u2019s biggest poetry movement and adopted the nom de plume Priskath. She was born and raised in Maun, under the wings of her grandparents. Together with her cousins at the cattle post, they would gather around the fire and listen to her grandmother\u2018s great stories. Her grandfather used to poetically praise virtually everything on which their cultural sustenance depended, from rain to cattle. Though unbeknownst to her, those were the first seeds to be planted on her fertile literary farm. When Priskath started school she was already polished. Needless to say, she excelled in compositions and literature. Her writings are inspired by God and His art. She mostly writes about gender based issues but also touches on other critical life themes depending on what inspires her at that particular moment. As a young woman who adores the music and the power of the lyrics within, Priskath also gets her inspiration from well written Reggae and Country music lyrics.Her poetry expedition turned into a joyful adventure as she performed in every event that was organized by Poetavango. Being given the platform to perform in international events was indeed an honour and reinforcement of her talent. She performed in all the editions of the Maun International Arts Festival (MIAF) and in the Hundred Thousand Poets for Change (100TPC). Priskath yearns for the growth of poetry in Botswana. Unless and until poetry has reached the apex of its progression, she will not retire from the written and spoken word.<br/>\nShe says in her own words; \u2018The word is of utmost importance. It was there at the very beginning and promised to be there at the very end, who then can deny the importance of the word.  We poets and other writers need to ensure that the word reaches the masses in every way possible.

He went to Primary School at Botjhabatsatsi Intermediate until grade 4, and then changed schools to Hendrik van der Bijl in Vanderbijl Park where he completed his grade 7. He matriculated in 2003 from Suiderlig High School. He has an S4 in Chemical engineering and is currently studying for his BA with Unisa.He is the author of<em> Read, Write Dreams Into Life</em> published in August 2011. <em>Read, Write Dreams Into Life</em> is Rantoloko Molokoane\u2019s debut literary text. It is the culmination of a decade of writing. The book is a collection of poems and prose writing that carry his signature view of the world in which reality is not only viewed at face value, but holistically. This view is the foundation of his philosophy that reality isn\u2019t as rigid as it is deemed, as most of what we experience is the creation of men. The book deals with reality in its creation paradigm and not its existent paradigm, so as to provide the reader with the confidence to face their realities however diverse.<br/>\nFor a decade now he has been practicing his craft, nurturing it and learning ways to better tell the Afrikan story. In two thousand and one he turned his mind away from academics and began to observe human behavior in all its absurdity and from there the writing began. In 2008 he quit his job after finding himself immersed in unending depression because of a lack of utilization of his mind which led to extreme drinking. Since then he has been working tirelessly at his writing. Now with only a few years passed he has expanded from merely just writing poetry to even fiction novel (still being written). His work has been featured on One-2\u2019s album \u2018Microphone blank cheqk and on Inaudible poetry\u2019s \u2018Comprehension\u2019 compilation. Besides writing he has horned in on his experience of performing poetry for seven years to produce edgy performances that shatter limitations with their fusion of enactment and poetry so as to bring life to poetry. He has performed around Gauteng tertiary institutions like VUT where he was exposed to the world of performing; TUT, NWU, UJ and at venues like Cramers coffee at Balladry composition\u2019s poetry shows. He has also had the pleasure of performing at the Word N Sound Series hosted by Afurakan at the Bassline coming second on two occasions and at the KPN session held at Market Theatre Lab hosted by Jefferson Tshabalala. He has performed alongside some of the greatest poets like Romeo the poet, Inaudible poetry, and Quaz, and musical talents such as The Soil and Travellin Blak.<br/>\nHis writing is driven by the rich spiritual heritage of Afrika and the immense creativity that lies in the depth of its heritage. Driven by that he has found ways of writing material that awakens all to the realization that what we deem to be reality is but a mere fragment of a bigger reality that exists where creation moulds what we finally see. Adamant that imagination is the key to breaking the bondages that anchor us in a reality that seeks to diminish us into the confines of a reality of those who have learnt to use creation to their bidding, he writes awe-inspiring image centred writing that challenges the reality that Afrikans are faced with by exposing the hidden boundaries of what is. A strong believer in the quest to findings ways of celebrating Afrikan indigenous knowledge systems so as to once again instil pride in the Afrikan, especially the one battling with a township reality that instils despair in the minds of the Afrikan.<br/>\n\u2018More than a writer I am a mere township boy who read to the point of seeing beyond the blinding surface of all.\u2019", "location": "South Africa", "poem": "[<p>He was staring into the night sky as it bled<br/>\nfrom its womb lessons in the form of beauty.<br/>\nHis eyes wide shut, having been stapled closed<br/>\nby mother nature\u2019s nurturing touch.<br/>\nHis mind as still as the carnage we ceremoniously deploy<br/>\ninto boxes, that are then later concealed.<br/>\nSix feet far from our tormented souls.<br/>\nOh hail all things seen<br/>\none day will fade and never be seen.<br/>\nOh hail all things seen<br/>\none day will fade and never be seen.<br/>\nHis possessed mouth began to utter<br/>\npossessed by the magic exuded by the invisible angel.<br/>\nIlluminated by the glance of that unselfish king<br/>\nthat reigns only at night.<br/>\nThen it all ended and all that was left,<br/>\nwas a face that seemed to have been<br/>\nsupernaturally reconstructed into a smile.<br/>\nResidues of this impermanent event.<br/>\nAnd I stood addled<br/>\nI the god, creator of this haven of madness.<br/>\nA meticulously crafted painting, with strokes from the unknown<br/>\nanother product of insanity.<br/>\nI the prisoner, shackled to elusive poles of limitations.<br/>\nBy thoughts, perceptions, the tools of the mind.<br/>\nThe mind, the very prison I am confined in<br/>\nthe puppet, attached to the mind by strings of thoughts.<br/>\nTo reap torturous movements when emotions pull.<br/>\nI understand nothing, seek nothing.<br/>\nFor too many a time have I thrown pebbles of thoughts<br/>\nupon the surface of this perceived ocean<br/>\nof comprehension, seeking a destination<br/>\nwhere purpose and sense can be found.<br/>\nBut only for this ocean to swallow them<br/>\nand I being attached drowned to a mere human.<br/>\nA worshipper of the untold tale<br/>\nof the ice maiden that fell in love with the sun,<br/>\nSeeking nothing else but to serve<br/>\nthe sun\u2019s heart with platters of eternal euphoria.<br/>\nA tragic tale that still flows<br/>\nin the crevices of this life, intoxicating seekers<br/>\nfarmers that water the seeds of suffering<br/>\nthat deeply in the fields of their lives<br/>\nwith their tears.<br/>\nAnd if poetry be another medium that perpetuates understanding<br/>\nthen consider this as ramblings of the consciousness<br/>\nscribbled in the book of life.<br/>\nI, the god that never understood creation.</p>]"}, {"bio": "RasTakura- founding member of Royal African Soldiers, nominated for the International Reggae and World Music (IRAWMA) award in 2011 \u2013 Dub Poet of The Year.His work covers not only modern issues but critical ones that need to be brought to the forefront.

The lyrically dexterous MC is one of the most exciting young artists in Zimbabwe right now. Thriving on versatility, Synik switches easily from cleverly crafted soulful hiphop joints to hardhitting lyrical raps and spoken word pieces. A gifted rhyme \u2013 storyteller Synik is known for weaving words to create visual poetic pieces. The ever growing artist recently picked up guitar playing and has incorporated acoustic guitar to his performances. He prefers to use his close relationship with words to influence positive change and inspire people, seeking to \u2018write songs to right wrongs\u2019. Affiliated with Zimbabwe\u2019s cultural activist movement, Synik understands that art should be used to address society\u2019s ills and he aims to do more than merely entertain with his work. Influenced a lot by conscious hiphop and neosoul music, the artists lyrics are mainly an expression of what the he encounters in life.\u201cThe soul of Harare\u2019s conscious Hip Hop is in the safe hands of a small group of rappers. Among them is Synik who brings some positive and thoughtful messages at a time when just about every cheap African rapper is claiming a million haters and self-stamping themselves as \u201cKing of Swag\u201d. (the peoples hub).While in high school a young Synik started putting his thoughts into raps in his school note books having been a fan of hiphop since he got introduced to the culture in his childhood. His high school had a large community of people who were also drawn to hiphop as an art-form. He was briefly part of Bulawayo based underground outfit, Encrypted Minds in 2001. The moniker is a remnant of this phase in his growth when he was influenced by hardcore underground hiphop. He started recording late 2003 in Harare, a period where he worked with the Phranchyze members Phlow and BC. His first release was an EP (The Beta Version 2008) which highlighted Synik\u2019s storytelling skills and lyrical prowess. The EP has been labelled a street classic by some and it earned Synik respect in Zimbabwe\u2019s hiphop community. He also released a single (God within/Find a way 2010) which revealed a more soulful Synik. He has featured on numerous projects including the African hip-hop mixtape 2, as well as collaborations with numerous Zimbabwean and African acts (Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya).His performing career developed when he got into Harare\u2019s lively spoken word/hiphop scene. He would soon become one of the most regular hiphop and spoken word performers at events such as Mashoko, The Circle, Chimoto Poetry Slams (Alliance Francaise), and the Acoustic Nights (Zimbabwe German Society).

The time & emotional commitment required for this, however, would never see her second-guessing her place in the performance poetry zeitgeist. The major themes of her written work centre around the issues of womyn in the setting of modern South Africa. She works intimately with womyn on a daily basis as a medical officer in obstetrics and gynaecology.She discovered stage poetry in 2005 when she met and joined a 7 member poetry collective and inspiration, T.O\u2026T! Together they introduced poetry to different audiences and challenged the status quo by performing fluid collaborative pieces that matched different styles of poetry and used the physical movement of 7 poets to tell a single story.She has performed poetry for international movement to stop violence against womyn, One Billion Rising (2013, 2014). She was part of the cast of a workshopped theatrical poetry performance called Secret With the Moon; part of the Arts Alive festival (2013) and was invited to perform at the Melville poetry festival (2012). She has judged various poetry slams like Word n Sound (2014), Drama For Life, Lover and Another (2013) and has helped in preparing prolific, talented poets for the stage for Drama for Life (2014) by conducting workshops to observe and guide their performance technique and discuss and impart knowledge on the subject matter\u2013sex and sexuality.

He says that the \u201cmorally decaying political culture\u201d corrupts the soul of the nation. The poet does not want to see his home country being a passive nation that is too afraid to confront the ills of society. He invites the nation to revolt. He is committed to take the nation on the revolutionary road. The poet is amongst many young Africans who are getting tired of the corrupt political systems and want to see a selfless leadership that will restore Africa\u2019s dignity and pride.</p>]"}]}
