They were playing that celestial music
The notes rang out as time dragged down
I slowly climbed the stairs
And every one of those stairs was sound
solidified
Like an organ made of stone, Then the coffin came into view
It was shining brighter than the Sun
But not quite as bright as the Moon
And I was unafraid .òcos I'd been here before
so many times and I knew
I'd be coming back again, Then a woman started dancing
And I felt her rhythm when it crawled up my
feet
And became my rhythm too
We were both born in Gauteng
And the earth roared under our feet
I could see the sky through somebody's eyes
But the eyes were not my own, Then we stretched our umbilical cords
From the Hillbrow Tower to Devil's Peak
Where she played her silver bow
And every one of those notes rang true
And my heart stopped beating
.òCos I didn't give a damn
If I lived or died
All that mattered was her and her sound
As they lowered me into the ground, So say .úcest la vie.ù to the broken-hearted
Say .úbon voyage.ù to the newly-weds
Always say .úI love you.ù to the one
You wake up next to
But O my sweet little darling
Don't you ever say .úforever.ù
Forever is a very short time"

hidden,
until the sun rasps
its black breath over
the suburbs. Only then, do I edge from
my demure murmuring disguise,
carrying my pen like
an axe,
waiting in the underbrush for
the first bloodwarm faces
to appear. I like, to slaughter the meat out
of them, to space
their soft stomachs across
the page, to stretch
their sinews into
stems and curves,, or else
to pull their wet skins tight,
nailing them down around
the white silences
squirming. I never, wash my hands
after .ì the whimpers dry
to innocent ink under
my nails. And besides,, I keep my tools
hidden., The reckless sleeper, Time,
I thought.
Coffeed &amp; inked. Light scarred against mirrors while she practised the world on paper. Kafka crumbling against the comfort of spoons, scarves, skin.
Time,
I thought.
Desire watercoloured, worn like a locket. Who dares not to speak?
Not to run like a child after a blue pigeon? Not to offer the mouth for eating,
not to follow? Who dares not to? Step in, fall through. Kissing crows and candles. Again.
Time,
I thought.
And Leonard wept as she chose the colours of this place:
rhubarb, tea stains, ginger, asphalt, biscuit, scissors, guinness, tongue, memory, bone, canvas, railway, wax, egg, fire.
Time,
I thought.
A reckless sleeper. A puzzle of objects, a guarding blanket. The horror of a blue ribbon. The hollowness of hats. Something to touch.
Time,
I thought.

Sketching comparative analysis
That cannot be defined by the architect of her hips or backside
These words a microscope into her body smile and mind
Aligned with the testament of time
That by breath, dust and rib- from Adam
A masterpiece unfathomable was fashioned and formed
Beyond conventional norms of society's
Stating-
All they were destined to be
Are
Child bearers,
Victims,
Punching bags,
Secretaries,
All things derogatory,
Burden carriers,
Wives
And a mere shadows of the xy chromosome.
I said a lineage of greatness is born
Women who have stood on the front lines of battlefields
Yielded their present for the future of others,
Mothers of inspiration, civil rights movements,
Preachers, prophetesses, goddesses, and nothing less
Than bravery,
Affectionate and gifted hands
Unafraid to be transparent in lifting up their vulnerability
To be seen, to be heard,
To be living monuments in historical chapters
As their resilience and virtue
Combine to project a relentless spirit and boldness
Confined in the stride of her walk
Her talk oozes proverbs
The universe is but a herd
Flocking to her breasts
To suckle the milk that strengthens
Young ones
Ones,
Become two,
To become mass pedigrees of masterpieces unsold
More precious than Gold
Woman-
You ought to be told that you are indescribable and ridiculously exquisite
This pen visits the passages and corridors
Of your silent pain and wars
To find you
Undefeated
Unscarred
And
Victorious
Let your notorious cellulite map out the geography to a sight called
Flawless
Your fat will be the pillow of consolation
That more women may embrace their imperfections that are but perfections
In the eyes of .úloving yourself regardless'
Your bones are the rock where men will be grounded
Your dreams founded and accomplished
And your skeleton relished
In the undisputable truth that YOU
WOMAN
Are Phenomenal"

who can't keep a man so she has to steal somebody else's.
We just don't see eye to eye on much, that's all

and anyway, your mum cooks with too much salt., It wasn't so much an affair, you understand
said Auntie Amy, lacing up my brothers small Nike trainers
and picking out my knots with the wooden comb shaped like a fist
but a meeting of minds outside of our respective vows
And bodies, muttered mum, when I told her later.
Two faced tramp. What a joke.
Don't tell anyone I said that.
Don't tell anyone I said that., It's not as though your mums exactly an angel, either
said dad with blood red eyes
and a pulsing vein in his forehead
finishing the last of his whisky
and auntie Amy hissed, Easy Winston, you've had enough
and dad said, Don't tell me what to do
not even my wife yet, and you think you know it all., It not that your family are going to hell, necessarily
said grandma, boiling up the green banana, yam and dumpling

Who am I?
Unburied self I try
To conceal from
Those who pry?
Or the me I wear
From day to day
Capricious mask
In pliant clay?
Everyone has a part
In designing my face,
Yet  seems such a private spot
For so public a place, WELCOME TO THIS POEM
Welcome
To this poem,
Make yourself at home.
Would you care for something
Refreshing, some light relief?
A cup of tea perhaps?
You must be exhausted reading
All those poems,
And when one thinks of the unfigured
Multitude (can you bear
The thought?) cross-breeding in bottom drawers.¶, It is a long, bitter winter's night and who dares
Be an arbiter of taste in times like these?
And- oh the poet?
He's not in today
He's out selling life.
The big companies pay
Well, not forgetting the benefits,
And they love him
When he is angry."

Wipe my feet before entering the house
After a walk in the rain or on snow, The second decade .ì I learned to put on lipstick
Look in the mirror before
Leaving the house
Look at a boy without letting him know
I was looking
Look like a lady without letting Mama know
I felt all womanish inside, The third decade .ì I learned to wipe other people's noses
And love it
I learned to put another's interest before mine
Love and duty were but two sides of the same coin
Complain?
Me?
What did I have to complain about?
I was fulfilled! Grown up, married, with children and all,
A roof over my head. A boiling pot on the stove
And a man who told me, at least twice a day,
He worshipped the ground I walked on!
Yes, sometimes, very late at night, he reminded me
How much he loved me .ì
Very, very, very late at night; when the children were
Fast asleep.
Whenall the dishes were sparkling clean
When the floor was swept free of all toys,
Dusted, and wiped free of meddlesome footprints
Yes, sometimes, late at night, he reminded me
For the third time that day, how much
He loved me., The fourth decade .ì I watched my own children,
My daughters, make goo-goo eyes at boys
When they thought my eyes were closed
My ears deaf as stone
They whispered tingly secrets; made subtly suggestive
Gestures. Amused, I watched it all .ì thought, inside,
I sighed; amused to see the pattern repeat itself. Oh, my
God!
Embarrassed, I remembered my own na√Øve assumption of
My mother's blindness, The fifth decade .ì there was no denying it .ì my children
Were grown. Yes, they were my children; but they,
Definitely, were no longer children!
Did this mean I was old?
How could it be .ì when had that happened?
I was just discovering my essence!
Discovering joyful living sans fear of pregnancy,
Sin or ridicule! It was in such ecstatic sensuousness
I entered, The sixth decade .ì let no one misguide you,
The fifties are for fleshly fulfillment, sinful
Delight, and sprightly goings on. Now, at last,
I knew all there was to know about life.
I'd even made it, from scratch, myself
Gave it flesh, blood, and bone
Knit and bled it into being,
Nurtured it to healthy maturity., The seventh decade .ì I learned to live with loss
A huge hole came to live in my heart
But I learned to understand this:
The loss is as big as the love. I suffer
Greatly for I have greatly loved
I am grateful for the love that was mine.
I suffer, but I could not have asked for less., The eighth decade .ì I learned to live with
Fewer and fewer friends
Fewer and fewer visits from my children
As their own lives grew fuller and fuller, I love the four walls I call home
I love the skin that houses the bones I call my body
I love the people who, a long time ago,
Were my children
I look at their clean noses and know
I have lived a good life. Look. Just look!
How they truly no longer need me!, The ninth decade .ì I will learn the meaning of hours
For time is short, each hour more precious, therefore!
The journey is definitely longer behind me
The road ahead lifts with joy as I see
Footsteps painted a bright and
Joyful gold!
Without a doubt, I know, those are the footsteps
Love has made.
Mine has been a long life .ì rich in experience., But now, looking back, I see all those brilliant
Moments in my life are moments of loving,
Of giving to others. These are moments
When I transcended the self and its
Imperious demands. When I was for
Another .ì whatever it was they needed
To go one step forward: wife, friend;
Mother; neighbour; daughter; sister ; or
Stranger!, Yes, I can see: I have been a good citizen, a decent
Human being.
Now, I am eighty years old .ì I hope I still have
Time enough to catch up!
Pass me that damn bottle of wine, will you?"

Still, the Caribbean will never leave her.She believes that the written and spoken word can set fire to the positive action and social change that is waiting in our bones.",Trinidad and Tobago,"People who only know the Caribbean
as palm trees and turquoise seas
ask me what language
we speak in Trinidad and Tobago.
I answer, .úEnglish..ù
.úWe speak English..ù, But as soon as these words escape my lungs
as silent rage rushes out behind it
scorching my insides
releasing an aftertaste of fire
and charred history., You see
our English is not the English
spoken in Buckingham places
and high afternoon teas.
Our English bears the remnants
of imperialistic invasions,
the pillaging of minds and bodies,
only to discard them in foreign fields for profit., And so, to remember the language of that forgotten land
we began to re-member your English
infusing ritualistic rhythms in between
the pockets of your verse., We spoke in macheted syllables
that bled blood
mangled and diluted
by your white diction.
We sang with thick tongues
that rebelled against anglicized pronunciations:
the dead arms of Africa
throwing ghostly spears at every word
mutilating sentences
like black backs in sugar cane fields,
disembodying its structure
restitching adjectives and verbs
making ordinary nouns objective
the body's abortion
of the language of the Queen., Some people tell me that some Trinis sound British
but no matter how true
I refuse to hear it.
Cause when the British hear music
they may dance
but when any Trini hears the pounding of a drum
we wine and grind to the beat.
The music is our exorcist
and we pray that with every bead of sweat
we drain every ounce of Europe
that linger beneath our skins.
Maybe the bending and twisting
of our hips and thighs
will divide the pain
of the contortion
of our lost mothers
whose native tongues
were hemorrhaged in the hull
of a shackled ship., People say that my accent has escaped me
after being immersed in New York City streets
but they're not really listening
because if they peeled back my words
like the flesh of the master burned
in plantations by men
who refused to be emasculated,
the stench of rebellion
would invade their lungs,
robbing them of the opportunity
to say otherwise., Unlike my great-great grandfather
who was branded with the name Joko,
my accent is free.
It comes and goes as it pleases.
But the spirit of its past
will haunt my thoughts for an eternity.
And until it finds the words
of its original dialect
to scrawl across the stones of its tomb
it will never find a sacred place to rest., 2008"

He didn't make a moon because he hadn't invented night
And then he made a hedgehog.
This is great fun he thought and he made some deer

and slipped fish into the sea and laughed
as he fitted eight tentacles onto an octopus.
Only then did he think of night and luminous moon.

And the moon and a scorched earth and an angry sea and no life .ì

Kwabo bakhe bakuthanda iinnyembezi ziyazehlela
Kube ngawe kuyaphela, Translation, Its That Moment
Its that moment you know you've stepped out and you have entered into love when it groans in your gut
Its that moment you step out of sense and make decisions in your sleep, because you feel like you're swimming in love like you're not on earth
Its that moment a door is closed and clothes and shoes are tossed, excitement taking over
Its when jerseys lay strewn, you see yourselves enter paradise, the stars shining and tears of joy flow when all the while you're making a gruesome decision
Its that moment when you're tickling, hips are thrusting and beds fold in then one of you hastens while you forget something
Because of the influence you're under, you no longer have .úcoats.ù and you have no care for them.You don't know you are slitting your own throats
Heavy breathing and under blankets.Its a clean war of love that you are deep in
You bask in that kraal of love while your heart sips in its water
Doors are tightly closed
When the journey is like this, a heathen can swear that God is love and treasure nature
Its that moment a man tricks a woman by saying he's against the .úcoat.ù, it doesn't please him, the ancestors didn't use it .úHere's our Lotto, lets take a chance.ù
The audacity! You take chances where there are no millions.Can you not hear that you err ass you're busy with the bum
Festivities! Lights are dimmed and while games are played till morning
Cries are let out, you're stunned by ecstacy as your privates dance and birds and girls ululate not knowing what else to do
Its that moment promises of heaven and earth are made .úEven in when I die a girl like you I'll always love.ù
You're in Canaan, the land of bees
By disregarding the .úcoat.ù you beckon danger
When this happens, angels underestimate/ undermine the pozie
A man will argue till dawn breaks like Nongwawuse saying his revelations can raise the dead
You can't even see that you're ruining things
Beware.Its the road to death you're taking.You're being lured
Its that moment alcohol drives and you're carelss not knowing you're digging your own grave, Its that moment in the morning you search below the waist searching for the .úcoat.ù under blankets
Then you're not sure.You ask each other endless questions
This news that you did not use the .úcoat.ù shocks, frightens, stresses you to the point the stud/ladies man/Casanova goes out the window, You don't want to tell anyone, you have not appetite and your own thoughts taunt you as you realise unprotected sex s a self-curse
You start to regret as a your heart thumps against your chest as you think of the repercussions. You want to hang yourself
Its that moment you decide to get tested as you expect death to sweep you away at anytime
You go to hospital and see patients waste away and you tell yourself that will happen to you
You curse women as you wait to see the doctor
Blood is taken, you think back to the day you didn't use the coat and your mind is warped in deep thought
Your mind thinks here, thinks there
No time to beat yourself up.You are alone in this
You sit on the chair worried, your chest is shackled and the blood has been taken
You're restless and your soul waits for your death, you can smell death
You're sentenced by fear, you don't know your beginning from your end
Admit, don't deny.There's no denying it.You didn't know that day would have you breathing with difficulty
In this world, you cannot put your brain where your foot is and walk with it otherwise you'll find yourself in a grave
Look at you, contracting HIV because of your lack of a brain
Months have passed and you don't take your treatment.Instead you're a slave to alcohol and people are watching
We keep saying life is rough when we're the ones who kill themselves and by the way the devil has no power
This battle is your own.Stay strong and let life go on
Its that moment you're imprisoned by your thoughts and you think back on the day alcohol influenced you
You're overwhelmed and this virus eats away at you,you become thin and you keep cursing life
You keep saying life is about trying while you're a bone in the grave
Thought break through the noise of the pandemic that destroys your lineage
You beg the Creator to take you, you have even given up on eternal life
You can't walk or eat on your own.Your friends visit your bedside encouraging you to hold on
Those on the sidelines gasp, they want to ask questions but can see the virus if eating away at you
Its that moment your mother cries above you
Gutted she cries .úGod you're my fotress even when the future id bleak, one day it will be okay.ù
You know the angel of death is on his way to fetch you
You shrivel like a dying flower as sickness engulfs you
Believers await to sing funeral hymns when God releases you
You're are healed
Thorns are removed
Its the moment the coffin is lowered
Tears flower from the faces of those who have loved you
And that is the end of you]"

".úBorn to flames
Conceived in between rows
reared to spark riots
and fled the norm.ùThese are the lines from a 30-year-old Free State's spoken-word activist and poet, Serame Makhele popularly known as Icebound. He uses these words extracted from a piece called Poet's protest to introduce himself, in a nutshell, to audiences. Icebound draws his inspiration from countless Pan-African writers that he studied and read as a youngster and continues to explore.His unique style of performance which he termed Rhyme and Reason, Rhythm and Content, illustrates a perfect incorporation of rap and ragga into classical African poetry and literature. Icebound prefers mainly to write and perform about hardcore socio-politico and economic issues. This can be proven by words quoted from his controversial piece titled Burn dem up and destroy dem:Capitalism and fascism
Modern-day Nazism and imperialism
We use spoken-word as a mechanism
To burn them up and destroy them",South Africa,"Born to flames
Conceived in between rows
Reared to spark riots and
Fled the norm, Circumvented paths of super stars
This royal son
A societal black-ship that causes riots
Even during this season
When status-quo questioning
is labeled as chaos
A non-patriot
that treads harshly on red carpets
Even at times at gala sermons
Where imbibing venom
Is a vivid norm, A random pick-up on issues, Now check it, Unemployment, poverty
And countless other foreign concepts
Injected forcefully into the mindsets
Thinking tendencies of my peers, I'd like to launch a protest, Against the prevalent ignorance
Of today's writers, the so-called poets
Who see but refuse to speak
About what the eye receives, My awareness-campaign to you poets

Today's peace means war

But Hani, Biko, Sobukwe
Never planted seeds

You're probably not but
The voices in my head are
Persistent
They insist that
You don't like being here
Much, that you feighn
Pleasure when our skins touch.¶
That one day this house of cards is  going to give into the whims of the most subtle breeze and fall to the nothing it was before and I'd flat line through life like I did before, Love, my love, was a story best told in between the folds of a Disney book
The perfect romance was a Hollywood rom-com of blue eyed, blonde haired tall and thin girls, no illusions there, I knew my day would never come
I'd grown accustomed to the cold.
The ice in my mind had long extended its sharp fangs to pierce my left ventricle,  no amount  of look like love glue could stop the bleeding.¶, Too many a time this lass has been disregarded, used and discarded. So many want in and when they see me they can't wait to get out Because of this I'm guarded.¶ So this being loved for real stuff is new to me.¶ Believe me.¶, I prayed for you, meditated for you
Burned incense, toked blunts and the bliss that engulfed me, were visions of you. Through life's BS visions of you sustained me. You heard my soul's most primal call and beyond the cosy snuggles and kissy faces you're here to transpose the darkness I hide with quick wit with the light your green chakrah emits. You're here to love me., So yes, I'm scared.¶ not about you leaving or cheating.¶
I'm petrified
                   of you standing,  amid my ruins,  and,  looking around,, slowly,,                                          intently., Even more terrified of you saying you're staying. Here.
Making THIS your home
When I hate it here most times, it looks like the colosseum.
It was a battleground for demons and I. And I  was the one always meeting my death., But  here you are.¶ Finding beauty in spaces I find ugly,
It jarrs my mind, how you care for nothing but caring for me
Even when I make it hard. Especially when I make it hard., Even when I'm fighting you I'm wanting you, when my actions say leave, my heart's begging you to stay. When you get a little too close to my raw bits, I spew venom, it cuts like glass. The shards that tear into you, are pieces of a broken me that have been buried beneath my toungue
for all my life I was browbeaten so I would learn to hold my toungue.
When I lift my tongue to kiss you, you ventilate graveyards.¶ these ghosts aren't confined by wit or decorum, or keeping face, or etiquette, no, no, they glide through any fences and pretences put up, and, find you. I want to cut my tongue off. Even now, I'm afraid to speak. And here you are.¶, Listening to me.¶.,                              Ramble.¶,                                                   Again., And with bloody lips, fearlessly, you kiss me again., You kiss me., The voices in my head hush.
For love so true banishes death from my breath.¶
In this moment I'm drenched in your strength and sage knowing that love will battle for love.
I KNOW now that love isn't something you're told, it unfolds its self in the rubble of your soul, Hand in hand we walked through my soul today, found the ruins of a temple. The one demons had trampled, in unison lips parted and began to fashion prayers in tongues
Hossanahs hummed by contracting lungs to the beat of pounding drums of love muscles fist bumping one another through our chests knowing that in this shrine is where forever rests and to this the rhythm of life can attest."

In this poem the poet reflects on issues that consume many African countries. He says that the .úmorally decaying political culture.ù corrupts the soul of the nation. The poet does not want to see his home country being a passive nation that is too afraid to confront the ills of society. He invites the nation to revolt. He is committed to take the nation on the revolutionary road. The poet is amongst many young Africans who are getting tired of the corrupt political systems and want to see a selfless leadership that will restore Africa's dignity and pride."

Hupata vingi vitita, pesa na vingi muhimu
Bali kutnza utata, watoe zamu kwa zamu,

Wapatapo hujinata, hudhani wameitimu,
Wenda chezea karata, kamali japo haramu,

Utawaona wapeta, supu ya mbuzi kwa ndimu,
Kipato wengi hupata, kutunza ndiko kugumu., Mkulima wa ufuta, mahindi kwenye misimu,
Huvuna mengi mafuta, na kufanyia kalamu,
Njaa inapomkuta analia hali ngumu,
Kipato wengi hupaata, kutunza ndiko kugumu., Wanaume ni matata, matumizi kemkem,
Mishahara wakipata, na posho za kujikimu,
Nyumba ndogo hujikita, pesa zote timtim,

1.Many get an income,			Taking care of it is where it's hard
You get lots in stacks,		Money and many things important
But keeping it is controversial,	Pay them off turn by turn
Many get an income,			Taking care of it is where it's hard., 2.Many scoop up an income,		But they do not respect reserving it
They get it and stick to it,		You would think they did not graduate
They go and play cards,		Even though gambling is a sin
Many get an income,			Taking care of it is where it's hard., 3.People cry over getting cut,		They never stop blaming you
In the evening when you go by,	And at the bar they sprout
You will see them there,		With goat soup and lime,
Many get an income,			Taking care of it is where it's hard., 4.A farmer of sesame,			And corn during the right season
Harvests a lot of sesame seed,	And puts it to pen
But when they get hungry,		They cry that times are hard
Many get an income, 			Taking care of it is where it's hard., 5.Men are trouble,			Their spending is wreckless
When they get their income,	And with allowances for sustenance,
Their small houses focus,		And all the money is blown
Many get an income,			Taking care of it is where it's hard., 6.Poetry is not a battle,		They are teaching words,
If you end up getting stung,		The truth does not become a poison
Today, I Mwami, scold you,		Tomorrow I will greet you,
Many get an income,			Taking care of is where it's hard."

ATHENS SE MA SE  P@¬£S!, Translation:, The poet of this piece speaks from the point of view of a working class individual who makes the connection that South Africa has helped to bail out Greece. The same Greece, whose Capital City Athens, nicked Cape Town in the 1996 Olympic Bid. The speaker reflects on the excitement, which he experienced on the parade in 1996 and cannot understand how the South African government can help the country out who made him feel a false sense of excitement. The speaker dwells into social issues, which are faced in Cape Town, for instance standing the .úwrong long lines.ú in the day hospital waiting for medication. The recurrence of the phrase .úAthens se ma se.ú shows a build up in the characters emotion towards the spending of money on another countries bankruptcy"

The Words or the poet the question I suppose is which came first and
Ask yourself.¶. not which answers you are seeking
But rather, my sister my brother which questions you are being, Like is my Father's blood, inheritance, debt, a curse or a blessing
I am a Hybrid of hell but of course the heavens pre-vail
Diabolical as every devil in your details, every demon in your purse, the urge of man to derail
And vice versa conversations had with females like Adam had with God long before he fell
When snakes used to be fly before Eve's betrayal the first the time the sky cried began to bleed conceived Kael, I'm falling to pieces, calling your secrets out one at a time , Like Lazarus leaping from the darkest and deepest recesses of the dark in your heart and mine when I dive through the depth of the mind no pretext only  to emerge from the sea blessed holding up seas crest element of the feminine divine in my thoughts eminent in my heart and my mind, half the time, but never in my hands as I watch you turn to sand I said goodbye.¶but why?, And she was like:  *Divine me a new melody we can both learn to move to
When things don't shine and shimmer or sparkle just like we're used to
Losing .¶winning, whining loving living it is all the same
She speaks to people through love poetry, prose God and album names
Not to confuse you, it's how she communicates she's not insane
(Not to accuse you) I will excuse you for losing heart again
Judgmental, you're losing the plot and mentally losing faith
Brainwaves hold the keys to the way to make a relationship stay, the same
Or change Instead of straying from the course of course I speak too much, i teach too much, and reach too far, she speaks we kiss it's a trap we're stuck for days I oscillate and pendulate like fly paper we're stuck for days
I touched today with her tastebuds, what a fucking awesome way to wake up and breathe the air with her great lungs prefecture beauty no make-up.¶  Google search is there hope for the end, lost connection download didn't end, trapped inside her emotion again, because her wounds opened again now we broke up again, tonguetied on a tightrope now my tightrope became tightrope around my throat and I know this is going to lead us to back to where we came from.¶but not to the way it used to be.¶, What's the progress report, there's venom in our rapport
Remembering hours she poured into the fountain but who's counting
Shut up it's pure she said with the flawlessness that lured Adam
She said it was just okay but there's greatness in Lucifer's planning, Now the enemy approaches, hidden dagger in the shadow of her heart/ is probably the locus of her hope and as the artful dagger darts it's
A crying shame she's Hoping causing pain will cure her pain it's so inane
How much of her will stay the same, how much of her remainS unbroken, Hope you're staying focused but I'm talking shit, I know this
Her teeth are daggers at my throat I know but hardly noticed
Coz I'm not even focused.¶ when I'm far I'm at the closest spot to you
I ask my head that's not the truth
I'm furthest when I'm not with you I wanna walk with God with you
I wanna walk in a Godly truth
This poem lacks a certain answer,  , .úTear down these walls for me. Stop me from going under.ù
I hear your heart ache, i hear your each and every beat // As your heart breaks.¶ I recognize my feet in every piece, my efforts are feats and soul release, break, fast, bones, skull, glows, face reflected and yours too those pieces are now little more than platitude, dust, grounds, allowed, bitter salt, seeps in like light through the blinds, but, life is a grind and as I cut my fingers searching for you and me I finally see that this ain't quite as sweet as we initially made it out to be, this ain't our movie this isn't sugar glass, my fingers slashed on fragments of love and a childish hope that has become, the fragments of God, At 6 minutes past 2 he was born not crying but blue
The biggest parts of his body where his head and his fists and you
Know the story is mine and you know that glory is defined by the Maker
And so am I don't tamper.¶ semper fidelis, The darkness has been sanitized the Light has cured the cancer
The stag, the Wolf the arrow flies the poem and the answer
What's the question you are being bide your time to see the master
Chop wood, carry water, keep calm and feel the aster
Pasta
Bad idea for first dates, the first taste and first base the first days of hell fire
And I fall require aid, need this bomb rewired A, B the race is long but supposedly it's with Self
FELT, stealth approaches, don't forfeit the game, Dishonor your family, hopeless again don't forsake or forget your name
Remembering always that the sky is not the limit and neither is outer space
Your limit is inner space and you are God within that place"

Whirling round and down the drain
For the water welling round my eyes
As my tears leak joy and pain, For the water in my belly buffering baby boys to be born
For the water breaking down my legs
So that I can feel my newborn's head, I give thanks for the water, I give thanks for the water
How I yearn to swim in your sea
Soak my dreads in your salt and then ring you out
And let you power shower me, For the water in my belly buffering baby boys to be born
For the water breaking down my legs
So that I can feel my newborns head, I give thanks for the water, And the golf course strips you daily
Drinking gallons and gallons to stay green
While the mamas fill their pails on their daily trails
Walking miles and miles for a drink, For the water in my belly buffering baby boys to be born
For the water breaking down my legs
So that I can feel my newborns head., I give thanks for the water."

moved with planets in her stride
and seasons would alternate between her eye blinks yet she carried heaven as her pride
but it must have been a bad season
coz she doesn't smile now
but now she wears fear as a cushion just in case she bumps into those memories still haunting her sleep
rests with an eye open, keeping screams as her guard and a rope attached to reality to pull her self out just in case she sleeps too deep
hips sway to a careless rhythm for music no longer inspires her
and love is an empty burden only carried only by fools who believe in fairy tales
and i remember she used to believe in fairy tales
she used to believe in black magic and that witches were the lucky few who had escaped the clutches of life
she used to believe in reincarnation after speaking to the man on the moon
she believed in a higher being and that salvation was coming soon
dreams were her play ground and the world her colouring book
she played stones with the gods hugging freedom as her blanket
she cried only to create endless fountains of youth
carried wings on her shoulder blades for she usually flies with time
and pain was only a strange perception in the corners of her mind
and i remember but does she want to remember?
does she want to remember?
those endless moments when hell was left to walk the earth
and had she had a choice she would have easily chosen a grave over birth
that cursed day when the sun did not wake up and the night booked a room in her heart
when flames of hatred and fear painted her pupils red replacing the stars that usually glow in her eyes
but she doesn't smile now
but now she has a score to settle with life
she had a deal with fate but certain things just did not go right
at birth she was promised that the sun would always shine
but never told that the same sun would scorch her back and lengthen the days of her miseries
never told that the sun would set and darkness too would also become part of her reality
she was told, her life would have endless possibilities and that she must make the best of it
but never told that in reality this rabbit hole was in fact a bottomless pit
and that the same arms that love and heal could chain her future to residues of a night over spent
these very finger tips that polish her back with passion filled strokes could leave traces of confusion where wisdom once blossomed giving moods and colour to seasons
can u blame her? coz she doesn't smile now
and i can still hear her screams
her tears still wet my pillow that's why at times i drown in my dreams
so i scribble down her pain only to help (me) find the path
and this is for every woman and child who's suffered the wrath of my brother's hands
whose wishing well has run dry, who now looks up to a blue and purple sky
this is for every woman who has lost her smile
and this is for every child who has lost her innocence
this is for my brother who has lost his inner sense now"

Upon this quiet Hour
Dedicated, each one of them,
To you, my flower, Human beings can be very unjust
Some are dark, some are blind
She teaches me to ever trust
In the victory of love true and kind, She flows with the rhythm silently
Subtly sets the tone
Fulfils something for everybody
Each feels she is their own, She flows, stands, dances, hovers
Softens hunters, strengthens gatherers
She makes Knights of her lovers
Kings of mere gardeners, Defeats the desert in every heart
An oasis all on her own
Awakens new worlds, reawakens that part
Of me that has turned to stone, Be ever on the look-out for her
Like a watchman from his tower
Protect, when you see her; thus will you know her:
She who flows is the flower, She opens her heart for all to drink
Who bear the natural thirst
She expresses what all lovers think
Because she was the first, An irresistible smile is her crown
Radiating unselfishly
She lifts my spirit when I am down
Gives unceasingly, She arrests with quiet dignity
Humbly proud, vulnerable
Salvation of the concept of purity
Accessible but unsoilable, Natural, normal, ordinary
Caring, healing gem
She flows with her lovers' and guardians' story
Encourages, comforts, ennobles them, She awakens tears and gentle smiles
Just by being there
Beautiful above all transient styles
A beauty always and fair, Her lovely whiff, caught from afar
Releaser of the deepest sighs
She is mirror of heaven's star
Lights up my soul and eyes, She's nature's victory over human art
Mightier than pen and sword
Speaks deeply to the human heart
Without saying a word, And has one distinct feminine feature:
In her grace lies her power.
She flows with the currents of nature
That's why she's called the Flower.¶"

dan roem ek, ek sal altyd gaan
as die Vaderland my roep, Without waiting for night's pure purple cover
umbrella for licence
crimson brain
overheated behind fences
Meneer de Blank oils his gun
I drive in
past kafees garages
bare high gutters flowing with brown water
beside brick rectangles
spires where voices join with Meneer de Blank
to praise the Lord of Light
but my eyes have seen
motorist cruising where the road runs
by the grey river
long lines of Christians
whirling serrated wings against sunwashed blue
springkaan birds over the Bridge Motel
day dry windless
peeled trace of moon suspended
bowlegged beakwinged
cacophony of flocks
I coast by the grey river
watch children in scraps of pants
drop sticks into the water
then order hamburger and chips at the Wimpy
while the waitress with lemon perfume
says God's White Hands
lifted a curtain from the world
and there
behind that film
He watches Meneer de Blank
throw umbrellas
the blown heads of his woman/his sons
till loving man of glass turns the gun
on himself
sticklegged in the trees
locust birds watch
children swing their fish
cauliflower butterflies shimmer scales
locust birds unblinking
before the bodies in the brick rectangle
Man whose wife had to be sent Elsewhere
Man whose kids had to die on their beds
Man who would go shopping for shoes in a tan safari suit, behind a curtain in room 999
at the Bridge Motel
I switch on a television
to watch his white hands
throw purple umbrellas
all over Parys
all over the blowout

"Ama is a young lady born and based in Accra, Ghana. She loves other creative disciplines but writing is a deeply-rooted passion of hers. Writing is her safe haven, writing is her lifeline.",Ghana,"My eyes have known of some existence
I sink in the deep abyss of buried memories
For a time, a time of doleful longing
How divine the chorus they sang
How comely the master's flair
The cocks crowed in artless delight
To break the chaotic silence of dawn
Where the birds glided through the air
The sun shone brightly with a smile
And the moon came out just in time
To catch a glimpse of heaven's happy dance
The earth joined in seamless glee, The old men sat under dreary oaks
They puffed the smoke from the pipes
They battled in a game of draughts
They laughed with barely any cares
In their groggy woozy gait
They danced to the tunes
To the rhythm to the beat
From the bottoms of mere tree trunks
The folk music was sheer bliss to the ear
And men thought weak would plough
The lands whose pride was the child himself, The children frolicked, wild and free
With only bare feet to spare
Tribute to the early days
With nothing more than little scares
A wild goose chase at noon
With nothing more than feeble hands
To capture and set free
Little butterflies and a smacked bee
They took flawless pleasure
In the face of pelting waters
Dancing all along
To same old music while beating the trunks, Women sought after their men
Daring frantically to matter
But still waiting their opportune turn
No attention to trifling flatter
When the old turned to the young
At the still running streams
Deep redes to their sorry heads lay
The old opine sound words of caution
While they bend their weak backs
And bear the basins on their heads
Within the basin she watches
The mirrored self of she, in yet another, Suddenly all light is bedimmed
Not a single flash can be seen
The old men have returned too early
To sullen graves in defeat
From the fight to thrive well against
The power of a strange forbiddance
The children have all fled
The fathers seek their pleasured youth
The fate in so much unrest
There is a life yet unknown
Suckling youth can no more be found
Mother, father hold on in reverend fear, Listen to the echoes from afar
Nature's dirge of her dearly bereaved
The mother is denied her pride
The womb is shorn of her worth
The children of her pleasured youth
Can barely open their veiled eyes to see
The mother so called crouched on her knees
Desperate in her lowly state
She is yearning with the age old plea
He had wooed her with so much of purity
Promised he would never defile
Whatever she was, he would preserve, And now there she lies
Vile and dejected
Her eyes once brightly shining
Can no more break the murky dawn
A life once treasured
She swears to deathly tolls
To avenge her forgotten labor
Now the children of men
Can only bring the bearer of fresh suckling bosom
A mickle of letters telling of poor bemoaned regret
She is left behind
Her own unsullied self, So now all and sundry born of a womb
Struggle to severe the cord
That binds us to a treasured past
Somehow we forgot steady steps we trod
In the way, in the shadow of a selfless being
Whose tones we bear well on our coat
And whose love we have coldly betrayed
Who would have thought a lover
Would weep herself to sleep
And wake to see her lover's eyes
Filled with nothing but sore disdain
Her heart is held still, in profound silence, And so now purity has borne
Children to our dismay
With much of scorn from birth abased
They trample the belly that carried
They set the heart to bleed
And soothe everything but pain
They seek fearlessly answers
Questions to which she has not an idea
A mother wails for a rebirth, or rather
She wails for the death of a beloved
Who yet lives in faceless solitude
On what was to be hallowed grounds"

The album fuses disparate genres with impassioned narratives of tragedy, redemption, and revolution.

A blind man watching
Our brothers die, And I've built our coffins
Much too often
It gets so dark when
Our mothers cry, I know more than I want too
But not nearly enough
I thought I was writing for the love
But it just turns to be lust
And my trust in us was gullibility
The reality is just that
I'm not who I was
Nor who I will be
But sometimes I feel me visiting
And I fill me with the lush scent of soul
The flavor of feeling
The rush of color
I think the pleasure will kill me
The pressure squeezes and spills me
To the language of the unseen
The unthought, and the undreamed, And my heart begins to pump
The thick/ rich/ fluid of verse
Searching for a simple word or phrase
To fill the phase between
The wet nurse and the black hearse, And I know sometimes my words
Lack worth
Lack depth
Lack gerth
Lack the distance to travel from
Heaven to Earth
Or from mind to brain
Or from soul to flesh
I hold my breath and my hollow hope
That my hope ain't hollow, It's just a message in a bottle
Or a genie in a bottle
Or a wino and his bottle
Or a baby and the bottle, The symphony of me is stuck in staccato
Like a broken/ break beat/
Breaking the vinyl into
Bits of blackness spinning in circles, Come down Selecta
Last night the DJ took my life
But left the speakers empty
And the speakers speechless
And the dancers still
Dancing or not
They don't see our music as musing
Merely amusing amusement
How could they know in
Basement booths
We've balanced the nexus between
The soul and the flesh
And the science and intellect
We rock genius like a necklace
We drop jewels in gutters, But they fooled our mothers
Into thinking that they could raise sons
In the darkness of night
But isn't the night always dark before the sun is raised?
And when the sun is raised
Doesn't he make the block hot
And the eye squint
And the breath sweat
And the tree grow
And the children play
The rays sun makes the pavement see
The wavy apparitions
The mirage of the future, But I know
I am a dead man walking
A mute man talking
A blind man watching
Our brothers die, And I've built our coffins
Much too often
It gets so dark when
Our mothers cry, So now I'm walking the thin line
Between love and hate
Between words that are spoken
And beats that break
There's a thin line between
A bullet in the chamber
And the bullet in the brain
I'm civilized, sane, with a little savage in me
There's not really a little savage in me
Just a lot of passion in me
And sometimes the soul rolls
Outta control without a glass of rem'y
And some people are fine with being slaves
Just as long as massa's friendly
And let us spit fire into match
Until the mag' is empty
You don't need to pass the cem'y
To know there's a little assassin in me
Just know
There is no soul taken accident'ly
The angel of death has an itinerary
Snatch you right outta your Bently
Right outta your Gucci jeans
Right outta your Fendi
Right outta your dashik'
And right outta your Kente
Allah has written in his book
And there is no erasing the pen's ink
So why do we ignore what God knows
And rely on what men think
We're just boys in the backstreet
Just tryin' to get in sync, But my balance is off
My talent is lost
I've married my art, but
She's barren of course
And I hear in her voice that
We're headin' divorse
So before court
I may have to kill my dreams and
Bury the corpse
I shed a tear for the loss
I feel like I'm bearing the cross
My conception was so far from immaculate
For the most part
We're just a bunch of bastard kids
Our fathers are gone
Caught in the cycle of sadomasochism
Because our lives are dead wrong
But resurrected like Lazarus
Cause our mothers are strong
And our romances are just about
As romantic as the master's kiss
But we have got to move on
And our lives are about as painful
As the master's whip
We have got to move on, I wish I could sing for justice
But I know no such song
I know about Shohada
Souha and Koran
Jihad, martyrdom, and homemade bombs
I know you think I'm wrong
For talking about homemade bombs
But the leader of the free world
Can drop A-bombs and napalm
And got the nerve to ask
.úWhy do they hate us?.ù
When they still got the blood on their palms
They stay long
And sing songs about freedom and justice
All bloody day long
And claiming they're right
But they've got to be dead wrong
And maybe I'm just too drawn
And head strong, And now
I'm ready to run head long
Into enemy fire
It's like we desire death
I just got the same blood that
Pumps through a lion's chest
I come from a line of warriors
Who took off the leather vest
And sheathed the sword
And sprint into the thick of the mess
I am begging them now
Show me your best!, There are two possible outcomes:
One, I could send them to rest
Or two, they could send me to my lord
I like the second one the best
I will kill the killers who live
I've settled for less, Because I'm already a
I am a dead man walking
A mute man talking
A blind man watching
Our brothers die, But I won't build our coffins
And I will not take part in
The death of my heart's kin
I would rather die."

Tuesday, December 12, 1993
I sat at my window, gazing at the city.î
bright lights, lasciviousness &amp; lies,
sleek subway trains, and steel towers that soared
to the sky.
In swoons I dug the swing
of Miles' horn ridin the high hat,
bathed in the subtle static
of my old phonograph.
The wintry wind whistled
a somber tune as a lone cloud
vanquished the moon.
Echoes of gunshots hung heavy
in the air, and somewhere
a mad drummer played his beats.¶, Yo, there's that cat Nat.î
I lifted his rims a while back, 4:23 on my wristpiece.îA. M., that is.î
the phone rang, and who could it be
but Tracy
in herbal heights ramblin
bout her glittering dreams
of showbiz.îruby rings, candy-apple cars,
&amp; scarlet sequined dresses.  Baby,
I'm gonna be a star.
Miss Smile Brite 1979.  I was
Miss Smile Brite 1979.
At the age of five I was live,
&amp; I know my face was destined
for magazine covers.
She'd had many lovers
tryin to sex her way to the top.
Then, on her voice, rained the patter
of teardrops.îfallin &amp; fallin.
Tracy's bawlin drowned the sounds
of Ice beatin his wife in the flat next door.
I could do no more than listen
as the voice on the other end
wailed of having no friends
and of being alone in this city
of being so alone in this city.¶
In the daylight some called her siditty
but only I knew of her vulnerability
in the night.  Come on over, she said.
I need a shoulder
to cry on.  Then, a dial tone.¶, So I slipped on my gear
made my way
toward the West side of town.
Caddy out front, brothas smokin blunts.î
the dawn wrestled with the night.
The fiery ashes of a cigarette
lay dying on a stair, and somewhere
a mad drummer played his beats.¶, There's that pimp Kimp.î
duped him for a dimebag of hemp.¶, Slapped fives and gave dap,
floored the gas but had a flat.
Wouldya believe on MLK?
Got out, locked my doors,
Givin nods to the whores
packin it up for the night.
Went on trailed by a cop,
ducked into a doughnut shop
&amp; ordered my usual.
After done I made a run
two blocks west of Ashby
in the shadow of the rising sun.
Finally, I made it to Tracy's crib
on the West side of town., Yo, there's that nig Pig,
from whose hoochie I took a swig.¶, On the West side of town
I took the elevator to the floor
where Tracy stayed.
And from somewhere
near the end of the hall played.î
or so it seemed.î
the blatant blare of trumpet screams.
On the fourth floor,
Tracy already stood in the door
of apartment G.  Tracy was bawlin
as I was stalling, wonderin
what the problem could be., Can I come in?  In a daze, she nodded.
I poked and prodded
to find her trouble.
And she looked to the double beds
in her bedroom.
I didn't know what was in store
till I looked at the floor and saw
a pool of red.
My reflection in a pool, blood red., Lying face-down on the carpet
was a brotha.îdead.
I turned his face over, And it was me
it was me
It was me., And somewhere
a mad drummer played his beats.
A dance with death
to the rhythm
of urban percussions."

Exchanging blows with false reality close to falling sanity, If I was a thought I would build sacred temples .ì
Within souls where hatred settles as the devil's naked samples.
In your grey thinking matter I'd give rise to vagrant rebels., If I was a thought in blindness' mind I'd cry for support

Where cold roams through broken windows to kill souls of angry faces., If I was a thought I'd be no accidental idea-
Built on luck and co-incidence, harassed and strangled by fear

Windswept hills, whistling valleys,
Ice cold sweet waters
Laced with earthy rusty aroma, I remember Eastern Cape
With its bareback horse riding men
Its women with big washing bundles balanced systematically on their heads
Numerous housewives with big wood bundles skillfully placed on their heads
Newlywed grooms showing off their nice, elegant cut tweed jackets from Jozi
Young makoti`s busy collecting freshly dropped dung to paint their newly built houses, I remember Eastern Cape
Its narrow paths charmingly leading you to the river
At the riverside young maidens teaching each other
The enticing titillating hip swaying sensual dance ukutyityimba
Young boys competing to see whose isagweba will hit a bird first
Smaller one`s teaching themselves to whistle, Oh! Remind me and I will remember
Old men sitting under a big shade next to the kraal catching the sunset
Happily clad in worn out Stetsons, long warm military jackets
Shiny old army boots, without a care for the scorching heat., Smoking pipes on one hand, an ancient worn out newspaper on the other
Pipes puffing away into the future reminding me of my grandmother`s pain tainted lamentations `Wemk`ujujuju oomaqegu amdaka, wayomlahla eGoli umntanam u-Mabhudlela

Aged women usefully smearing old tractor oil on their legs
Never mind the legs then looking as shiny as aging English table legs
I remember seeing these people, I remember seeing horse riders preparing for the long journey to eBisho from Hukuwa
Horses clad
Nostrils wide open breathing out warm sweet
I remember watching in awe as women beaded their seemingly tattered dance skirts
which I must say took my breath away when they were finished., I remember times
when we would sit in the sun
with my cousins and laugh at grandma .úBongwe.ù
patiently separating the best corn from the bad
to show off to other villagers
how nice her land was through her crop and its bearings., Remind me and I will remember UMatshangisa
my elder paternal uncle's children's nanny singing her sweet songs
Her feet stamping hard on the ground causing a soft fuzzy surge of dust to rise
up, up, up till it disappeared somewhere halfway up her skirts.
Her shirt sleeves rolled up to her elbows
Busy as a bee sifting amarhewu and umqombothi
for the men to take with as they left early with the horses to Ebisho., I am reminded of the countless times I longed to be in those buses
bumping against sweaty mama's in the hot summer heat.
Bodies swaying gently rocked from side to side
to a land where the mind becomes a pen
that scratches and scribbles, jotting down this and that., I remember times when as a high spirited girl
I would watch dust trailing behind the Mayibuye bus
as it snaked down the Enqobokeni rock passes
taking me further and far away
from the mountains I loved., Like a carefully but tightly packed parcel I would rock from side to side
as my mother always over dressed us
for this journey with layers of jerseys
and every now and again a blanket, an attribute of her Sotho origins., I remember how I consoled myself for missing out on imibhiyozo,
I would picture myself with a big chunk of tender lamb and rice in my plate.
This was a ritual we observed when we reached Lady Frere, Kwa-Nonkunzi
where we stayed with mama as she worked at Glen Grey hospital.
Toiling away as a low paid nurse tending to people's lives,
I always wondered why &amp; how she couldn't heal my broken heart
From the dreaded disease called cultural imibhiyozo deprivation., The nice chunky meat was from a generous sheep
that offered us its meat which never failed to warm our hungry tummies.
My grandpa always slaughtered a sheep when we arrive for holidays in honour of us passing our exams and when we left. I remember my mother's excited face like a small child opening the white mealier meal packet that held our share-a hind leg.
Mama:Usiphe ntoni utata kule gem? Me:Umlenze mama., How remembrance is, remind me, and I will remember.
The time when I danced with my bottle top etched sack cloth skirt
and the few times when my distant cousin I still haven`t figured out how we are related who always seemed to be near, taught me and cousin Khaya to dance the boys dance,
.úumteyo.ù, through his fire lit shadow., Remind me and I will remember
how I was a girl during schooldays and a boy during holidays
hunting birds and herding turkeys. On an odd day out of Kaleni's sight my grandpa
riding the strongest of the male goat, damn goats smell but the ride was nice, Remind me and I will remember
the day we were sent to go buy
brown sugar at Romani village
and we got lost., How we had to skid down 50-70 metres long dongas
and how with our hot burning behinds, ever present distant cousin Thulani found and beat us because us city heads wasted his perfect afternoon
He carefully flogged us on the hands so the adults wouldn't notice
because we were sissies for being lost, we disturbed his rest as he had to search for us., Oh how I remember, sweet precious blessed memories.

You are an anti democratic leader, a dream vigilante,
Residing in the house of politics filled with politics, politically incorrect;
In the blatant disrespect and disregard for the people that helped put you there.
You have brought shame and embarrassment to this land.
You have unwisely chosen to bite the hand that helped feed you.

Force them to spend nights cramming selected, substituted and diluted  information,
 Then gauge them at who is best at fact regurgitation,
Teach them to expect everything from the gorvenment , yet give little.¶error give favours to them, Maziwa ya nyayo  serikali saidia.¶.¶.¶.¶ error,
Divide them into ethnical groups and let them have their heads
Make sure no man ever question his head
Who drills into their heads, that its us against them,

We would have water, if not or them
So let us vote not for our good but for their bad, against them,

exactly like me, and the man was weeping
for the houses, the streets, that whole fucking island.
Derek Walcott .ì The Schooner Flight, It started as I was leaving
with a dim groan in the afternoon.
I saw my grandmother
embrace me
in her hand stitched dress
and wrench my soulcage open., I saw vistas of apocalyptic Europe;
heard obscure tongues.
Till sudden now the sky become
peppered with woe.
Slack eyed soldiers were howling
in the wind.
Botched leper experiments
and gene mutations
with veins hung
like vervain from the neck., The sun long gone and weeping., The oil., The Devil., No doubt it was.
The Devil.
Who chased colour from the earth.
Who left sulphur where he spoke
like a jitney carburettor.
No doubt it was.
The devil.
Twisted muscle of night.
Who crackt
the sky glass lid., Maman.
Tell me again why I should leave this island.
Tell me again that those cities exist.
All I know of the ocean
is that a river
starts here., The day I left Mt Lambert
the wardrobe doors would gleam.
It was a day like any other.
Woodslaves ran and woodslaves waited.
Lovers lay against the Samaan trees.
Cattle grazed and bachacs burned
in matchbox discoteques.
And the sandbox tree released its fruit., But we were going to the airport
and my brother in the backseat
is him I ask : is me
this happening to?"

"Ari Sitas is a poet, dramatist and sociologist. A founder member of the Junction Avenue theatre company in Johannesburg, he was involved in most of its productions until 1982 when he moved to Durban.Sitas's involvement in popular and worker theatre since the 1970s has been widely celebrated, his broader writing and involvement as a leading intellectual in anti-Apartheid movements has left a trail of robust engagements within and outside the country. In 1978 the theatre company received the Olive Schreiner Award for his play Randlords and Rotgut, and in 1981 won an award for the video/film Howl at the Moon. His first collection of poetry Tropical Scars (1989) met with much critical acclaim, and he followed this with a collection experimenting with musical form, was included in the anthology, Essential Things (1990). Sitas's book, Slave Trades (2000), a result of seven years of research and writing has been highly praised. His last collection, The RDP Poems (2004) was his most disturbingly controversial with their precise and bleak analysis of current traumas in South Africa's transition. Rough music (2014) is his current collection of poetry. Sitas has also penned a libretto for an opera for composer Jurgen Brauninger, Dead Fish and Dreams of Love Again.Ari Sitas is considered to be one of the country's leading sociologists and has been elected by the International Sociological Association on the executive of its world council. Locally, he is seen to be a central thinker around the African Renaissance and of social justice and labour movements. He is currently working on a collection of his plays, a take on Around the World in 80 days (of which the India section has been completed) and a series of lyrics titled Insurrections done in conjunction with other poets and composers from South Africa and India.",South Africa,"From Jazz, Bass and Land, From Johnny Dyani

they jita-bug
There on the left: the Shembe horn-men, poly-scalar
Wheeze-in, blast out
My friend Futshane with a bow guts the double-bass low
Wherever there is music, there is hope
The phrasing is Dyani's, from Biko's Song to an
Angolan Cry, the restless dead intone.
Faster than the wind

slow, controlled, promiscuous,

slow, controlled, as language fails each octave
each slide, each pluck.

He is not there.
You expect Abdullah to place his left hand on the keys.
He is not there.

circling on the strings, as if he left the streets
and is really talking to the stars

Leaving the listener one breath short, a heartbeat far behind
as they are talking about some Mecca
or some spiritual den., At that, my ethereal friend
Don Cherry gets his break on the cornet:
Crystals exploding from Timbuktu to LA
each screech or squawk shatters the peace
dragging the bass, stretching the chords to counterpoint.
This is the language between madness and rebirth
The final circus act of a tradition, Before the brink, the pianist brings it back
Yes, yes, Melvyn Peters- dreaming Coltrane
earning his dough from tourists who demand more crap-eases
the ear, upbeat-swing so low and merry, tonality returns, redeems
and Dyani√≠s bass responds pure cheek, pure wily nigger., Oh no, Sazi Dlamini will not be outdone
and back from his Kunene-astral grooves
swinging chord and yoke, shining smile and blue
the Navy band breathes back to ooze
the Shembe horns awake to breathe. The bass responds
The big band soars and quietens
Leaving the trombone man alone
To grunt and exorcise the ghosts
The ugliest horn on earth, sheer chain
and joy
it obliges: even the ugly, love., But no, who let Ngqawana in?
No build-up but a cataract .ì aggressive wails
burning his lungs while squealing each three beats
to pause and scream some more at something no one sees,
at something everybody feels, The chaos calls me, can I sing?

The round red one on the leg
comes from an infected insect bite,
and reminds you of a weekend away in KwaZulu Natal.
The pockmark on your forehead
was from chicken pox at twenty-one.
The indent at the top of your nose:
childhood acne., You remember holding a mirror in the bath, aged five,
Too young then to realise it might slip, which it did, that night,
cutting into your knee.
Too young then, to know about the scars of the flesh, markers of a life,
signposts along the way.
Visual memories of what's happened when,
individual as fingerprints,
yet more arbitrary and irregular., They surround us, these markings, on others too, friends,
family, those we have loved.
We remember a cut on a thumb, where a tendon hung by a thin filigree.
Or, the scar of the root of a tooth ripped out,
the thin gunmetal lining around the capped tooth,
when our loved one smiles, reminding us daily of a root ripped away.
The mottled patches of brown that scatter a boyfriend's back
tell of childhood eczema.
The cigarette burn fades,
but the child remembers the startled look on her mother's face
as the cigarette was dropped accidentally.
Or, can you count this, the grey on the crown of the head,
sprouting forth? Another scar perhaps,
another reminder of time's stealthy breath., YOUR FACE
The face changes,
is changing, mercurial.
Trying to hold onto it
leaves you chasing images
that fade as they appear.
The night you held the blanket over your face
like a veil,
you were someone else then,
head tilted coquettish.
Or the days worry etched itself clean
across your features,
and I could only watch., One day you throw your head against
the wind, and it etches your hair across your profile,
and I too carry that in my head.
(but most aren't like that of course)  , You laugh, exposing teeth
and I want to catch your laughter like music.
Another moment that tinkles past,
rippling through me.
There are times I see your mother in your face,
and your brother, the line of family that runs through us all.
And there are times when your eyes are closed to me,
and that's all part of it.
And then also the softness of making love,
your eyes soft, misted, close to mine,
your face softened by the moment. , This is a hard poem to write.
In trying to capture you, your face,
define you by the mercurial moods of a day,
I'm left with images. The word is so hard, (word is hard?)
and yet the memory of images,
so soft, delicate.
I'm wishing there were other words,
another way to say it."
"Artist and Writer Jacqueline Kibacha, also known as the Pretty Poet, has a passion for words and a heart to raise the voice of the voiceless. As a creative strategist she uses her poetry to document and respond to the tensions that occur in the world around her and the human soul within.Originating from Tanzania, living in the Middle East and currently settling in United Kingdom, Jacqueline Kibacha has gained an understanding of issues faced by her brothers and sisters across continents in the light of different cultures, faiths, relationships and politics. It's hard to be exposed to so many places and not gain a love and appreciation of the colours, textures and rhythms and sounds from East to West. All of these are incorporated in her poetry and music.Her pre-poetry performance background is in acting and singing. Being a soloist in various choirs, classical to gospel, and also the lead female vocalist of a reggae-funk band that was born in the North East of England. Her creative influences include artists such as Lauryn Hill and Nina Simone who match the weight and richness of their voice with lyrical content that is thought provoking and socially aware.Kibacha has been a newspaper columnist but has also studied and enjoyed creative writing and is fascinated by the power of words. Through organising music events she has cultivated an eclectic taste in music, which fuelled experimentation that started with sounds and words. In her pieces she fuses the love for words with music, collaborating with DJs, musicians and producers to create poetry with a purpose beyond words on a page.With a professional background in project planning and community development Jacqueline Kibacha works with like-minded organisations to set up projects that use creativity to address needs, gaps, issues and obstacles in the community.",United Kingdom,"Because it was a deep wound I had, a deep cry.

Give ourselves titles like gay, coloured, man
Defining ourselves by an external criteria
Causing inferior and superior social cast systems
That governs who we are,
Dictates how we act,
Polices our will
And controls us with fear
Leaving us useless, enslaved, another numbering a system,
Another face forgotten, another life unfulfilled.
Then, at the end of our time here, to be placed in another box
In the ground with writing in concrete stipulating who we are
Or who it is that we are conditioning ourselves to be
If I could cast from myself this face, this skin, this legacy
And no longer feel the need to complain
Or fit into boxes that refrain
Maybe then I could wear the label sane?
And if I could find a religious or a social system,
A surrogate reality,
A fable
A once upon a time story of misplaced glory
Maybe then I could comfortably wear the label me?
Which box will I fit in comfortably today?
Who must I be in order to get paid?
Why stray when there is a paved way?
Instead of being somebody new
Let's all just press replay."

Metropolis
And El Paso
Is the rest of our country, Where we leap
Small children
In a single bound, With a single
Bound book
We teach them
That this, Is the land of the free
And the home of the brave
For those who come in 1st
Place matters
1st, 2nd and 3rd
Place matters, In classrooms
All about race., Race to the top
And pretend no child gets left behind,
My behind.¶, No child left behind?
My ass., Bringing boot straps
To a track meet
Is useless
We need shoelaces
And sneakers
To pull ourselves up by
Place matters, Undocumented
And unheard
Place matters, Because Superman
Was an immigrant too
It's just that his eyes were blue, Even if he couldn't fly
And Metropolis had a fence
On the south side, Clark Kent
Would be safer
Than a Canadian kid
In the Tuscon Unified School District, Place is the difference
Between a Whole Foods
And a whole block
Of Fast food, liquor store, check cashing spots
Like we can live
Off of sodium and saturated fat
Malt liquor, Flaming Hot Funions
And title loans, Like,
We can live.
Place matters, Like the difference between
Art class at the prep school
And class warfare at mine, Like time off from work and
Doing time, The difference between
Home schooling
And mom working
Third shift
On job number two
For you.¶, And being crushed by the news
That yesterday
You decided not to show up at school, And yeah, you hear her
You hear her when she says
What she always says
And says
.úBoy, they got a place for people like you.ù, And they do
Place matters
It's the difference between
Her being able to afford to ground you, And paying rent, Knowing that
When she goes to work
Yo ass is going to leave the house again, Place is the difference between
Latch-key kid
And homeless, It's the difference between
Him having health insurance
And her telling herself not to get sick, Not to get sick
Not to get sick, We are out of place
Like a fish
Pretending water doesn't exist, Because we don't want to drown
We are out breath
Jumping into boats, Running away from water
Chasing after Cokes, Instead of running for office
We're running out of votes, Instead of building communities
Foreclosures got us running out our homes, We can't even workout on our leisure time
Too busy running out the door, Can't buy no sleep
Tank on .úE.ù
But we thank God
For the little bit of exercise we get'
Even if it is
Just
Running out of hope, Somewhere
Between El Paso, TX
And Metropolis
Superman is waiting for us
To find him, Somewhere
Families are migrating
From the Navajo nation
To get Internet access
Like it's the New World, Somewhere
Poor colored folk
Are moving Uptown
Into the heights
Far from the flood zone
Like the Jeffersons
Thomas, George and Weezie
Like the Great Migration, We have have no idea where we are going
But it can't be worse than this
Place matters, Somewhere
Between two large bodies
Of water
We are nomads
Navigating our lot in life
.¶or our little, By stars
And by chance.
Displaced people
When it matters most.

They suck their energy from slimy cassava
And age-rusty taps: till they make a Benz, And I ride in the Benz: festooned
With striped rags and python copper coiling monsters
While the workers clap their blistered hands
And I overrun their brats, They build their hives: often out
Of the broken bones of their mates:
And I drone in them .ì .òstate-house'

And eyes already blasted with wielding sparks
And me speaking a colourless tongue, But one day a rainstorm shall flood
The litter-rotten hovels
And wash the workers' eyes clean
Refresh the tattered muscles for a long-delayed

Tale of entire, entirety.
First there was God and God said .úBe..ù
So there was.
And it is,
So it is!
But to who?
Did he speak to you?
Or me?
Neither and either.
He spoke to We!
We were there.
Always have been,
Always have seen,
From the serene to the not so,
And all that was in between.
We had foreseen the unseen.
Yet to share,
But we were there.
In our root manifestation,
The primary creation.
The first that was,
The last that will,
And until this realisation won't be fulfilled,
This crazy ranter shall rant!
Dust!
Humble magnificence,
Unnoticed beauty.
Self-assured silent bearer of eternal truths and original secrets.
Bang!
Big!
Bigger!!
And that mighty, thunderous discharge thrust out into newborn space, freeborn dust!
Filling and spilling as packets into pockets of space and time,
Like a desert sandstorm.
For a while.
Then that initial rage and ferocity cooled and turned spectator, to marvel at the magic of creator.
A world from dust was about to be formed as swarms of these tiny, insignificant, ineloquent particles joined, from their own inherent attraction, and thus from dust, stars did form.
And hence planets!
Stardust,
Fire.
Tale of entire, entirety.
Of the genesis,
This just the surface is.
Upon which I'll scratch on further.
Human.
The best of creation.
Powerful, capable, potential for greater things.
For nobler things.
To soar through skies with inspired wings.
To venture high and dare to bring destiny to his or her own whim!
Human.
The best of creation.
Powerful, capable, potential for greater things.
But gold nor silver brought forth this wonder.
.úHe created him of dust then said to him , .úBe!.ù and he was..ù
And thus, with dust, our cycle completes.
Unity found throughout, through in.
That from which the stars and planets were born, gave rise to human form.
A system entwined, interlinked, that binds us all together on all levels.
Extra,
Intra,
Within and without.
No one therefore, greater than another.
No one life more worthy, more deserving no other."

than to be itched and scratched
by little lacy things., But a few weeks went by and I realized

I thought: What is a little discomfort
for a coquettish sensation,
if it puts a spring in my step

At church,
Pubs
And strip clubs.
With pastors,
Prostitutes
And drunkards.
In pursuit of happyness,

And fleshly desires.
Sang happy songs with Hedonists
Travelled with Nomads,
Got high with Rastas
And broke bread with Pariahs.
Camped on bended knees around hell-like fires
To listen attentively to grown men liars., Slaughtered sheep,
Goats
And cows
For this little bit of sanity
And crowded peace of mind,
But my hands are smeared with blood
And the dark cloud still looms closely behind
Where the hell is this love?
I only know hearts for pumping blood.
Not as an asylum for
Said feelings you people cannot even describe., And do you remember
When god said .úlet there be light!.ù?

To write this poem
With my tongue in the grim dark
I am convinced collecting empty beer bottles
And picking bread crumbs is my birth right.
I am still in hot pursuit
And the journey now leads me
To a mad house."

That waits for the messiah., Country forever frozen
Singing melodies of pain,
Melodies that swell in the air.
Country
Of once half buried faces
In the earth,
Of once murky,
Bloodied rivers
And unbridled cries., Hush of country
That waits for the messiah., In silence lies the dread
For the night,
For the descending darkness,
With it idle,
Unresolved, nightmarish dreams.
In the hush lies hope,
Hope that bears no face,
No resemblance.
In hope and silence
Waits a once young man,
Now old haggard and wrinkled
Who waits under the baobab
For his beloved,
Beloved who ceases to exist.
In excruciating silence
Waits the young for the bus to pass,
For the dust to rise then settle,
For hope to appear then disappear., Hush of country
That waits for the messiah., Silent land of dry riverbeds,
And weary hearts.
Country of mud huts
And cattle pens.
Of the woman in the field,
On the grinding stone,
Of the philosophical man in the savannah.
Of the hoe digging,
Rain falling,
Seed sprouting,
Green then brown.
Of seasons
With reasons
For visions.
Of the grinding stone,
The trudge to the well,
Fire in the hearth
And love in the savanna.
Of reasons
For seasons
With visions., Hush of country
That waits for the messiah."

Are planted in our hair.
The big, bold afros of the 70s;
Strong, powerful, confident,
Greeting the sky like a clenched fist
 Defiant in their stride
Bobbing from side to side., The kinky close shaves
Of the first African slaves
Sweating their way across
Salty seas in strange ships.
Bald heads bare like broken backs
Split, and sliced by a whip,
Red like a watermelon., Then came the liberated heads
Of emancipated dreads,
Skanking to the reggae beat
Flashed in black, green and red
Reclaiming souls that were sold., Through our African hair
Lives our culture and landscape
The geography of our African spaces
The peopling of rural and urban places., The kinky curls, dry like beans
Are like the open bushes
Sparse and scattered across the desert
To withstand the harshest seasons.
This is the Kgalagadi mop
With very little on top
To stop the sizzling sun.
Our African hair, so brittle
Is like the dry moretlwa sticks
And the hard brown berries, so little.
And up North beyond the Sahara
Their heads are not like our Savanna
The women have flowing strands
Black like the darkest wintery night
Long and sinuous like the Nile
That weaves through many lands;
Tropical forests, rich soils and barren sands., But now in the new age I fear,
And openly have to declare
That we must really conserve
Our endangered, polluted, African hair:
It's immersed in oils of all sorts
Steamed, creamed and preened,
Like plastic goods, glossy and sheened., Our African kinky curls
Have straightened and unfurled
Like ropes and strings
And sometimes look like they will
Take off on their own wings., We must preserve our heritage (hair-itage)
By conserving and protecting our hair
Because in every black curl
And every black strand
Is rooted our African world;
Our very African brand."

Not only will she headline each show, but will also moderate the panel discussions, which will include special invited guests from various industries such as art, film and journalism.",United States,"Sometimes silence is the loudest kind of noise
Like sometimes it was best when
Girls were girls and boys were boys.
Like back when freeze tag was a mating dance.
Like back when .úDo Over.ù meant you got another chance.
Like back when anxiety was worrying if Wonder Woman would make it out alive.
Like back when freedom was sliding backwards on a slide.
Like back when success was jumping off a swing and
Landing on your feet, then
Doing it all over again.
Like new shoes made you run faster.
Like getting Ms. Gross again for math was a disaster.
Like failure was a word we hadn't even learned to spell yet.
Like promises were sealed and kept with pinky bets.
Like a challenge was a double dare.
Like ugly was a cock-eyed stare., And you liked it.¶
Like when you flipped your eyelids inside out
To impress that boy across the room,
.òCause that's all it took.
And there was no such thing as too soon,
As long as you checked the right box in that note from across the room,
The one that he.¶passed her.
Back when, .úI don't know, maybe.ù was a legitimate answer.
Back when, .úI need space.ù meant he needed more elbow room to draw,
So he got on the floor and he colored outside the lines.
Like the lines of color were on the floor,, So we just existed in sandboxes and playgrounds.
And we hop-scotched and dodgeballed
And everything I needed to know, I learned in a shopping mall.
Like don't wander off on your own,
Like know who you are,
Like know where you came from,
Like never let go of your mother's hand no matter what you do,
Like if you get lost, just stand there until someone finds you,
And someone will always look for you
Because someone will always miss you
And someone will always find you
And when you cry, someone will always remind you
In that quiet, quiet lullaby voice,
That sometimes silence is the loudest kind of noise."
"Bernedette Muthien co-founded and directs an NGO, Engender, which works in the intersectional areas of genders & sexualities, human rights, justice & peace. Her community activism is integrally related to her work with continental and international organisations, and her research necessarily reflects the values of equity, societal transformation and justice.
She has published widely, written for diverse audiences, and believes in accessible research and writing.
Bernedette started reading poetry at political mass meetings and other public spaces while at high school during the 1980s. Her poetry has, among others, been translated into Spanish and Portuguese, and published in the Americas, Europe and the UK, as well as across Africa. She is a core member of the Cape Cultural Collective, a progressive performance arts group with its roots in anti-Apartheid struggles of the 1980s. For Bernedette the poetic is not merely personal, but profoundly political and spiritual too.
Amongst others, she co-convenes the Global Political Economy Commission of the International Peace Research Association, is a member of Amanitare, the African network of gender activists, and serves on various international advisory boards, including of the international journal Human Security Studies.
She is co-founder of an indigenous scholar-activist network, the KhoeSan Women's Circle, in addition to convenor of an international listserv of Native scholar-activists, Gender Egalitarian.
Muthien was the first Fullbright-Amy Biehl fellow at Stanford University (1994-1995), and holds postgraduate degrees from the University of Cape Town (Dean's Merit List), and Stellenbosch University (Andrew W Mellon Fellow, 2006-2007) in South Africa.
Her current research centres on the Egalitarian KhoeSan .ì Beyond Patriarchal Violence, in other words, how social and gender egalitarianism are coterminous with nonviolence, as well as showing that nonviolent and egalitarian societies have existed throughout time and continue to exist at present.",South Africa,"i am a pig
rolling in mud

lunar plexus scraped bare
of all light, gothic

to fill an ancient prescription (condoms)
for pleasure devoid of dis-ease
and equally unwanted offspring .ì

cellulite of quivering corrugated iron
screeching in the gale, then like the township shanty i am
unprotected in the midst of this fierce cape storm
sweep me off my illusive foundations
wash me clean blow me dry
and set me free
of the infinite spirals of

let me step aside for hardier rhinos, white elephant bulls
centaurs and firedragons

Tits swinging from darkness to light
Hypnotizing me until I believe
In the blood that turns things white., Who is God?
The reason why my Sun never wanes
The reason why the Pastor√≠s never sane.
The Father who is also the Son
And the Spirit, the 3 in one., Who is God?
My upside-down frown; my plate filled with wine
My emptiness, my longing, my Shrine
My daughter√≠s dimples shaped like hearts
My Creator, my Potter, my Art., Who is God?
The one who is silent when good people die
Who turns away when people ask, Why?
Whose imperfect timing brings death and brings life
Whose blessings are real and sometimes a bluff., Who is God?
The woman who breastfeeds
Tits swinging from darkness to light
Hypnotizing me until I believe
In the blood that turns things white."

it would say:
here you lay with him
in this hollow
worn there by the lying together the lying above, below
the side by side of sleep., It would say: this island in the middle:
your youngest child
colonized it at midnight for years
wanting only your tired hand
burrowing for it like a mole
before she finally fell asleep., At this end
the bed would say
your son (once a boy)
flung his sleeping bag on the floor
to bring out the night near you both
after reading a horror story
too late, This bed would say: here, beside me
your mother stood
wearing your apron
saying:
please eat something
I will make anything if you would just eat., And here sat your daughter
singing nursery rhymes
while she stroked
your stubbled head., And here
the bed would sigh
is evidence of how you have worn me out
worried me away to barely nothing
through days and days of lying here;
(here
it would whisper
in this hollow
while they all slept
you lay awake, Waiting.)"
"Bilkis Moola is an Educator who works as a Head of Department in Languages at a school in Vukuzakhe, a township located in Volksrust, Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Her first anthology of poetry Wounds & Wings evolved as an introspective quest for recovery from her personal narrative of an abusive relationship. Bilkis presently divides her time between professional responsibilities and post-graduate studies in Education.",South Africa,"And I was right to take my flight. , This bird was from her age expelled,
Wings clipped and murderously repelled.
A spirit torn from her token of expression,
A talisman of doom in a husband of misrepresentation. , Bereft of hope she often spoke
Languorous listing in a burrowed moat.
Moans of sadness would her heart throttle ?
Choking sobs buttressed as in a brothel. , Departure from convential norm was difficult to resist,
Marriage torn and divorce in the crib.
The birth of an entity with an investment in self,
Who dared dispel the myth of she who sits on the shelf. , Merry melody and gurgles of giggles
Resonate rich in goblets of tickles.
Flutes flutter in a steady frenzy-
For wings to flap with urgency. , Jubilant in her journey she charts a cause-
Navigating ambition through discourse.
Of education in lessons on love lost
Despair not and possessed of a courageous plot . , Birds song in their euphony
Sings sentiment sweet in their symphony.
Harmonious is her composition-
Sound in emotion mental disposition."
"Billene .úBilu.ù Seyoum .ì avid word lover and travel enthusiast has been splashing words to paper since the age of twelve capturing her experiences of faces, places and spaces. Her poetry aims to take listeners and readers on a journey of re-imagining different imaginings of everyday existence. Having lived in five countries and traveled wide, Bilu's poetry embraces her global identity.",Ethiopia,"I understand that the forces that brought us together
Carry an intention much more elaborate than I can ever comprehend
That the day I felt your piercing gaze upon me
I knew that it was a journey I had to take., I understand that the pains and pleasures of my past
Carry a truth my experiences of today in relation to you
Cannot be defined upon., That the day I invited you to be you and you invited me to create together
I knew that I meant I had to dive into oceans unknown without a life jacket
And I dived first into a cove of emotions
That brought to surface my vulnerabilities and insecurities and countless uncertainties
In recognition that I am a microcosm of simple complexities., So when you ask me to swim to places
I have thought of flowing to yet never thought that those thoughts would come true
But just like the Alchemist's dreams would be a possibility to escape to
Then I become the pearl-less and pearl-full oyster that clamps close form fear
Teasing myself to be fearless, to being to fear less
Yet bookended between the polarities of an eternal optimist and a once wounded pessimist
Wondering if your realization of my grounded instability would make you love me less., I understand that to love you means to allow myself to risk suspension
In between the grays
Avoid running for the comfort of the black or white only days
Yet my confirmation to this invitation
Is also a response suspended in grays
For my colored words would give the impression that I have risen
Above all the emotions that make me human when in truth
I am simply a complex work in progress, I understand that while I choose to enter the space of authentic expressions
I am also a mere mortal conditioned to love only in one way, I understand that the heart is elastic and its ability to love more
should not be curbed but celebrated
yet I am simply a complex woman in love who would rather hear
that there was only room for me., But I understand
Because to love you means to let you be
The person that your heart wills you to be."

"Black pearl was born and raised in Zimbabwe. The 25 year old poet emerged on the performance scene in June 2010. Her poetry is impeccable and captivating to all poetry lovers. Her work depicts life as she experiences it, pointing out beauty, and humor. Blackpearl has taken part in events that include Harare International Festival of the Arts, 16 Days of Activism against Gender based violence, Acoustic Nights (hosted by Zimbabwe German Society and Wildfire Events), Intwasa Festival, Sistaz Open Mic, Bocapa amongst others.",Zimbabwe,"Blackpearl:, When a woman is loved, words cannot handle the situation
They cannot reveal the simplicity of the complication
She becomes beyond meaningful definition an abstract work of art and
Everything is too clich√© to put your finger on it
On that day poetry will not be enough; in fact it will be unnecessary
For the very toes on her feet will scribble art pieces in her path
Her veins will be a new form of vocabulary
And her breath will speak into existence the fantasies of her childhood
See, the beating of her heart will be like a djembe
The djembe sound will be music to her bones
the bending of her bones will be an unceasing dance
And The dance will bring clarity of the music in her head
See her head and her feet will be completely in sync
So that the thudding of her feet will be an expression of her beauty
And Her beauty will be redefined unconfined
For the texture of her skin will become as supple as the interior of her womb, Her shadow will mascara her body
Her hair will accessorize her face
And Her eyelashes will frame her vision
So that only perfection will touch her sclera
And her sclera will be as white and bright as the fullness of the moon
And Her fullness will absorb her beholder
And when she loves him
She will turn her mind inside out and put her head over her heels
Yes she will go crazy-maaad crazy
And impossible comes within the reach of her weaker arm
She takes the inadequate and sufficiently trickles it down her spirit
And it reaches her lover without interference
For the service provider connecting her to him is kept available at all peak and off peak hours
And the peak her connection reaches is beyond times measure
Hours won't matter no days won't matter and years will seem like minutes
She will  live in a timeless time zone
Yes she's gone crazy maaad crazy because she is loved., Itai:, When she can hear the silence
She is closer to God and furthest from the violence
the world of turmoil disappears and beauty begins to take shape
Everything falls into the moment, her torments fade away
Her sorrows are drained away as she flows into a world of no time
Listen to the silence that listens
the stillness that moves
the darkness that glistens
she is that silence
And she lives here forever more
and like that silence she expands and shrinks back into expansion
She is a beating heart
She is a meeting part
She goodbyes her way into Hello.¶, BlackPearl:, She will not need words to express her interior
Because her interior becomes exterior, extraordinary
Expandable, exciting .¶excruciatingly attractive,
Exactly the kind that makes you exaggeratedly
Try to make every word rhyme when explaining her state of ecstasy
But she will not need words because
Her voice will be a beautiful monotone
Even when she does not sing even when she does not speak even when her lips are not apart
And Her smile will be immaculate even when her face is expressionless, even if she were asleep
Because When a woman is loved, she becomes love."
"Blackheat is a young, multi-talented and passionate poetess, singer and percussionist from Zimbabwe. She exploded onto the poetry scene in 2006 after being discovered by renowned poet, Chirikure Chirikure who introduced her to the Book Cafe in Harare.Her talents are far-reaching and amazing to say the least. In the short space spanning her performance career, she has performed at the echelons of performance poetry in Zimbabwe. She has also spread her wings and delved into radio broadcasting, acting, publishing, advocacy and cultural activism.Her poetry is pregnant with abstract and surreal imagery, chronicling the social goings-on of contemporary Africa flawlessly on the traditional African beats of Zimbabwe and beyond. Speaking passionately on consciousness, love, revolution, individuality, freedom, culture and the delicate, critical balance of the mind and soul, her poetry appeals to people of color and light.Not surprisingly, she is inspired by the Malinke jelis of West Africa, the nomadic Wolof and the Tuareg people of Senegal and Niger, who have kept their heritage intact through the spoken word and music. This inspiration led her to form the band, Blackheat in 2011. She felt the need to preserve the traditions of her Shona people through the fusion of folk music, poetry, dance and thought-provoking lyrical content.With Samson Gohwa (percussion, vocals), Prince Zhuwao (mbira, balafon, vocals) and Itai Karuza (djembe, percussion), and herself on hwamanda-a traditional Zimbabwean horn, she started a journey that has given birth to a different understanding of spoken word, African music and dance.",Zimbabwe,"The way the dying sun dapples my brown walls
Each slow drag is a reminder- and a 21-gun salute., But the wind blows, ruffling the serene kaleidoscope
And each blob is suddenly restless
Furiously dancing to the beat of the Tempo Master
Because there is a furious virginity
When I stop and grapple with my thoughts, In the struggle to rediscover Self and All
And All and Self a beseeching, dying consciousness
Struggles to take root, Choked by minutes and hours of incessant self-delusion
Fuelled on by algorithms of negative thinking
Firmly embedded in the grey folds of conscience
Held fast by subtle criticism and debilitating, crippling intention
To deconstruct a life time of relevance
Stitched together with fear, insecurity and paranoia
Corrupted by selfish gremlins of vicious self-doubt sprouting in the soul.¶, A single iota of self-consciousness ebbs gently to the brim, And I refuse.
I refuse to be made to feel worthless.
I refuse.
To be made an object of scorn and ridicule.
I refuse.
To accept your categorical perceptions about me
I refuse to accept conditional love as a basis for being with you
I refuse., Today
Because today i am choosing to be just my very best
I am consciously shutting out the glares, the stares and the whispers
Because today i am brave enough to say that I am I.
And I am embracing and celebrating the image of the Godhead in me
And as the dying sun kisses my brown walls goodnight,
Naughtily winking behind the avocado leaves,
The gentle breeze strokes my soft skin
I am free.
I am free."

Stap saam die maan met wild in my hand
En n dans- wat jou sit in n trans
My voorgeslag kon reen maak,
Stories vertel was woelag!, Tog fasionable het krale gemaak en gedra
Was multi coloured, universal
Geguide, deur die sterre en die maan
Tekens gelos op klippe en op land
Medisyne gekry natuurlik-uit die aarde, Eers goed saam geliewe
Met verskille, maar tesame Proud van hul taal, ja
Toe kom skepe van Batavia
Mense van ander lande intro dinge van ander lande
Plus tale van ander lande!! Nou alles mixed tesame!!, Rise  , At times I feel stuck in this place called the Cape Flats
My mental's enchained, engraved in these streets
Where people roam, constantly dragging our feet,
No one to believe in what we are selling,
Yet we keep on buying and buying these lies and artificial living
Teach us to teach and learn our nations lessons
Motivate us with our own experience
So we can Feel again, Breath again, Believe &amp;
Rise like never before.¶, For, we're a people with history,
Roots, deeply rooted, we need to search for it
Not just any story, prescribed and printed with lies
Stories known and alive, with truth in it
So true, we can feel the life in it,
See the light in the sense it makes,
The time to awake is not tomorrow, its today
Where I can be taught &amp; see the light
Guiding my way, toward, the path where my ancestors wait.¶
To fill me and Bless me, so I can clearly see,
My truth at last.¶, Rise!"

I miss exploring your mouth, your mind
I miss delighting my tongue with your lips
And breathing in the taste of you
I am pregnant with this yearning
this liquid desire like
molten lava in my vains.
I love how you cause me to.¶mmmh.
You move me in ways I want to put into verse.
See, you inspire.
Poetry drops from my tongue
at the mere sight of you.
My fingers have recently
discovered a seventh sense,
and it's called .úthe essence of your deliciousness.ù.
With seven being the number of completion
You. Have. Made. Me. Come. Full. Circle."
"Born 1990, Nametso Dorothy Phonchi, affectionately known to her audience as .úPoetess Phopho'', was born and raised in Lobatse, Botswana. She is a BA Sociology and Environmental Science graduate from the University of Botswana. She is currently a Barclays- F.G Mogae 2014 scholar, pursuing a Master of Science in Environmental Economics stream at the University of Botswana. Because of her diverse nature, she is currently an intermediate level student at the Confucius Institute at the University of Botswana studying Mandarin Chinese, also pursuing a Post Graduate Diploma in French Language through the AMITY UNIVERSITY e-network learning programme.
As part of giving back to the society, she has volunteered with organizations such as Youth Alliance for Leadership and Development in Africa (YALDA), Humana People to People Botswana and Bird Life International Botswana.
She is a spoken word artist and a published poet, a Christian woman, a mentor, and a multilingual African child. She is the current Publicity Manager of Poetry Society-University of Botswana. Her writing and work emanates from the need to shouting the inner voice, speaking untold stories and voicing out stories of the gospel. She started performing poetry at the age of 16, at social celebrations. Her devotion to pen and paper elevated her to new platforms by later reciting weekly at the UB writer's workshop, Poetry Society Wednesdays, and monthly at .òSoul Poetry' and .òPoets Passport' at Gaborone National Museum.
She has since then performed in poetry events such as the International Women's day poetry event 2012, hosted by Alliance Francaise, the 1st and 2nd annual Multilingual Poetry Festival in November 2012 and 2013, gracing both events with multilingual poems and a Chinese song. She was a team member in the Tshwetso Poetry and Photography project, a joint project by the Botswana Society for the Arts and South East Entertainment to raise HIV/AIDS awareness in December 2013 to February 2014. She also performed at the Poetry against Poverty 2014, a charity event by Botswana artists and Angelous Society. She performed at the 1st Word live 2014 Gaborone hosted by Drea Chuma. The Poet has joined hands with other spoken word poets and Ann Gollifer, for a painting and poetry project themed .òOMANG' at Sophi Lalonde Art gallery in February 2015. She recently, she graced the Maitisong Festival 2015 at Thapong Visual arts Center and at the closing ceremony in Molapo Piazza.
Her writings kills were recognized in November 2013, scooping the first prize in a Chinese Poetry competition organized by the Confucius Institute at University of Botswana. She was awarded 4th world-wide prize in the WINDOWS TO CHINA & WINDOW OF SHANGHAI WRITING CONTEST 2012 (Shanghai get together 2012). In June 2015 three of her Poems where published on The Kalahari Review, an international online journal where African stories are told by African writers.
A performance she made at the Youth Arts and Aids festival open mic in recognition of the Month of Youth against AIDS March 2013 was later described in a local newspaper (Mmegi) column as rather .òprofound'. She has also been published in local News- Papers such as Mmegi Monitor and The Global Post.
Whether hated or loved, her poems will always be remembered for drawing inspiration for the old and young, black and white, rich or poor. She is mostly passionate about God, love, music, women and children and society which is where most of her poems draw from. Her poetry is inspired by rather seeing and hearing on a daily basis. With her book and pens, she aspires to lead future generations with poetry before her journey of lives comes to an end.
Often times she gets questions of why and how she writes and she has answered in her poem.¶
",Botswana,"I used to know of Goddesses with colourful wings worshiping their Gods,
I used to watch women and men singing hymns of praise,
Chanting biblical verses wrapped around their tongues
like wedding rings on devoted fingers
I wanted to be like these women,
But these days.., In my ghetto these days
It's pick a heart, pick a soul and shoot!
There are no more praying arenas in blood splatted streets
Just brothers, sisters and lovers covering their children's faces away from love
 Because we are all fragile skeletons
with time capsules buried in bare fields
that will never give birth to Proverbs 31 women of God!, My ghetto is loaded with jellyfish women with bruised hearts and chapped knee caps
Seeking love  in between road cracks and side paths
that do not know them names,
 So, instead of receiving their Adams in God's perfect timing
They fall prey to men who only find hiding places in between their inner thighs
Men that only want to touch and go, and sometimes come back again
Leaving women's bodies as temples with burnt scriptures
before dawn breaks promises of a new morning, I too have been a part of this someday,
There were nights when my heart beat did not beat for me,
When my dreams did not belong to me anymore
I too have tasted moments when men did not want to hold
just my hand, to read a Bible with me,
But have you ever wondered
 if Gods love ever break promises?
If Gods ears never hear your wishes?, I have seen a God whose face looks like the sky
 because when all things fall, I know I can count him
When sunsets pass and seasons fall,
 I know I can count him
Believe me friend
There is a God inside you with a tool box
meant to mend you into a perfect dandelion that does not wait for the sunshine
And I too,
 have never seen a field of dandelions trying to turn into roses,
Right now is a time to stop running.
Stop bleeding too much dandelion
Your heart is as stronger as a mason jar,
Your soul is a parachute of colourful ribbons and
God runs in every shade with shields of blessings for your entire lifespan., These verses and Poems are paddles meant for you
 to tip toe into his Kingdom, fly with me dandelion,
I am unfolding Jeremiah 33;3, 29;11 and Psalms 100,5 to you
 As oxygen masks, meant to give you a second chance,
 because in my father's house there is always room for sinners like you and I
Fly with me dandelion!"
"Born and bred in Nigeria, Bethel .C. Simeon, a singer, a songwriter, and a preacher, describes himself as .úan amalgamation of divers treasures that will retain the stamp of immortality until the call of purpose has been fully answered.ù.He earnestly strives to pull down the heinous walls of unacceptable manifestations while entrenching the pillars that aid the actualization of destiny.
B.C. Simeon, a trained journalist and a law student at the University of South Africa, presently resides in Cape Town. He has performed on the church platform to an audience peopled mainly by the youth. He is compiling his first anthology.",Nigeria,"What mammal dare deny the progression of her constitution?
What chick contends that time chronicles the alteration of her plumage?
Immortality is not the fate of infancy.
Permanence is not the lot of adolescence.
Who dare protest the progression to adulthood.
This too must herald the entrance of the grey hair.
Progression.The tide that embellishes our voyage with novelty and the unexplored treasures of the treasure house.
Why do you tread on the retrogressive paths that bind your feet with the shackles of stagnation? Has blindness dislodged the sight that beholds the atrocities of primordial ways?
Away with the fossilized formulas of stagnation.
Away with the cultures that bestow volumes of ruins on her practitioners.
Orators of this backwardness must not prohibit the eyes that see from roaming the length and breath of our habitation.
The ruins cannot be collected in baskets.
Consider now and call for the mourners. For lamentation has become the exigent enterprise if we must stem the tide of the ruins of these antiquated ways.
Consider your ways.
Unclog the cluttered minds.
Let the intellect ascend the throne.
Let wisdom design the colours of your formula.
We must chastise the proclivities the shape this indulgence.
Morality cannot be ascribed to the paths that bequeath the legacies of destructions.
Morality is the appellation we affix to conventions that do no wrong.
The meal of retrogression is garnished with spices that kill and maim.
The transient aroma of pleasure has pulled the wool over the eyes that are designed to see.
The enrollment of legions into the academy of vices cannot make it a virtuous citadel.
Rivers and ocean cannot wash away the spot that is embalmed in the tomb of eternity.
Do good to a spade by calling it the name that creation assigned to it.
What story shall we tell posterity when it inquires about the birth of this aberration?
Shall we contend with logics of falsehood and cowardice?
When tomorrow comes will my unborn child applaud the ways that bequeath her with the legacies of pain and ashes?
Will her lips speak the language of mockery?
Will her voice vent vituperations and curses on the grave of the man who laid the foundations of misery/
Can we x-ray these deeds of contention on the scale that weighs with the sharp sword of honesty.
Where are the hearts that pant for the redemption of these captives of antiquated ways? Do not cast off this burden of divine origin.
Streams of antagonism. Tongues of sarcasm and eyes of disdain are coming.
Emissaries of obstruction are coming. They are coming with brittle courage and weightless bravery.
They are coming with the facade of fear and words of terror.
They are coming with subtle schemes of deception and the snares of slavery.
Arise! Arise and take the spot of bravery. Wield the sword that sparkles with truth and liberation.
Arise and ascend to the mountain top.
Blow the trumpet with the force that cannot be denied.
Speak the words that resound within the habitation of deaf ears.
Roll away the curse of slumber and lethargy.
Ignite the embers of celestial fire.
Call for the baptism of change on the souls that are trapped in the abbeys of retrogression.
The gathering of the clouds speaks of imminent  rainfall.
Open your arms and embrace the inevitable."

Come on let's dance,

We are guarded by the trees,
Feel the breeze,
Don't let me freeze
Hold me please., We don't need insights,
Of figures and facts,
Let us use our instincts,
It's even in insects,, Don't just stand there,
The arena is here,
It's dark need fire,
No time to waste,
Hold me by the waist
We instruments need no test., The day has finally come,
The promise was to keep me warm,
So I stay calm,
To see that charm., What is the initial movement?
I follow every moment,
Mine will be its complement,
A pattern with great content., We alone no spy,
Look me in the eye,
It is real not a lie,
Our hearts are racing,
But nice timing,
I love this feeling., I swear,
You have conquered my fear,
Of monsters I hear,
Too bad this moment isn't to share., The food you ate,
Who cares for a balanced diet,
I see you sweat,
Not playing with a pet., It is not like those of child hood,
Of for a smile and feel good,
It boils the blood,
Yet it is soul food., The dance is full of pleasure,
It is a rhythm of nature,
It cannot be put to measure,
It does not work under pressure., Fighting couples,
Do not know how feelings are arose,
Dance and pose,
To admire what you chose., See how we complement each other,
Just perfect no bother,
Suitable for all weather., Relax and forget all misery,
Don't dance like you are sorry,
Tomorrow this will be a long gone story,
Enjoy our abilities discovery., Those at a distance,
Won't understand this occurrence,
Each dancing with obedience,
To our life time chance., Now this is my world,
No lies are told,
I don't want it sold,
Not even for gold., The first cock will come out soon,
Let us dance till then,
Later you sitting on the stone,
Me in the kitchen,
These memories will fill the afternoon., I won't be sorry,
You don't worry,
Silently we celebrate this history
Forever our hearts carry this jewellery"

He who since Genesis has been the nemesis of mankind and I,
Walked hand in hand last night
He said, .úFriend, I know we have not always seen eye to eye
And yes, it flows in my veins to kill, destroy and Lie
So tonight I'm going to take a minute to boast.ù
So we commenced our travels, coast to coast over the land I love the most.¶, Started off in the southernmost tip, the continent's Joy and Pride
South Africa, for decades, disenfanchized by apartheid
Now proudly standing apart as Africa's melting pot
But hold that thought, for in a flash someone fires a shot
For the same place I proclaim has earned undesired fame as one of the prime for violent crime in the world.
Enough seen, my fellow traveller and I headed to the next station
Crossing the border to the north, coming forth into Zimbabwe
Once Africa's bread basket, but no longer the case, now merely just a basket-case
And as we face the facts, we're gazing upon a place where inflation rose at a world-record setting pace
And while the people do their best to make it through the days and enjoy,
What can you possibly tell them when 85% of them are now unemployed
When they see the cause, but their tummies too empty to fight
You get the drift-thus went the rest of the night, As we, march across the Beautiful republic of Congo to the mystifying sound of the bongos
Tis hard to digest that an Eden so fine blessed with diamonds worthy of King Solomon's mines
Has played host to the World's deadliest conflict since the world wars
It feels like evil is floggin my continent on its back and we're down on all fours
As we, pass through Nigeria where tensions boil, when brother against brother, sons of the soil
Are wrenched onto opposite sides, ready to die and kill over oil.¶, Feet Away from Cote D'Ivoire and Libya
Little done and much said, we watch as their blood sheds
It's impossible to hold high your head, when you kneel to drink in these rivers of red
In a matter of weeks, power pursuit perverts people and produces preposterous freaks
Monsters who mindlessly maim and mobilize masses into murderous streaks, And in my dreams I hear the man telling me yes you can!
Wish I could look at the man back home, and tell him you too man
But my voice is merely drowned by the Janjaweed running havoc in Sudan
And as I watch babies torn out of their mothers womb over Darfur
I scream to the beast .úDevil, Show me no more!.ù, So we, walk away from some where a woman born is more likely to be raped than to learn how to read and,
Where AIDS has left the average human life at less than 30
And where child soldiers have murdered dozens before they are teens
And I'm tough but it got on my knees,
Even though I'm overseas, pledging allegiance to another land
Ive been crying and crying, for my sisters and my brothers and
Family and friends still residing on the motherland
And I asked .úDevil, why do we have it the worst, why are we living in death and Africa the hearse, why have you made the beautiful brown skin synonymous with cursed.ù, And he said, I told you I would boast, and I'd love to take the blame
All the same, it must be said, that man should be twice ashamed
For the guns in children's hands, the abused women, the disease and war that cause your continent to bleed
I would have no instruments to start the fire, if it wasn't fuelled by human greed
Gluttonous seeds planted by those who you watch as they feed
Corrupt politicians who equate money with the ability to lead
And as another baby starves to death, I hope we are mighty proud of ourselves
You've been the destruction on your fellow man, and the Devil hardly even helped"

in the beginning of the world
and in the beginning of my world
Words
have always been there
i fell in love with them as a little boy
that little skinny kid
the other boys thought strange cos he easily got bored
when they played with toys
i found joy rather in
Words
i pondered, tasted, wrestled, cherished
Words
truly words have been faithful to me
when i found her and desperately needed to express my love
Words
came to the rescue
i read them them when i fear
i speak them in despair
i take them with me everywhere
and so when i urged to speak a poem, i couldn't help but share
Words
the power, the depth, the length of 'em
armies have mustered on the strength of 'em
Words
wielded by dictators have made bombs drop
guns pop
and forced the ground to swallow innocent blood
Words
spoken by saints and diplomats have caused warring parties to sheath their swords
Words
my long lost love
my new found .òi can never do without you'
Words keep my bills paid so to words i'll always be true
Words
the power, the depth, the length of 'em
how often we despise the strength of 'em
by faith we understand that the worlds
were framed by
Words
so if words create, and indeed they do
then take them with you and create a better union between your spouse and you
use them rightly on your kids
and watch them sprout like well watered seeds
Let them
convey respect to everyone you meet
Let them
serve as a conduit
to pass encouragement to the poor and the needy
Let them
inspire insurrection against political highway men the corrupt and the greedy
Words
are colorless, without gender or race
so take them with you
and make the world a better place
Words
the power, the depth, the length of 'em
this poem is an ode to the strength of 'em"
"Born in 1981 in Hammarsdale just outside Durban, Hector S Kunene first journeyed into poetry at the young age of 16 and immediately his love for his art emerged. It was his love for poetry that saw one of his first poems Bloody Corpuscles published in the Sunday Times newspaper. Hector later moved to Bloemfontein where he pursued his childhood dream of publishing a book because .úI want to see people reading, I want people to start appreciating poetry again like they did in the days of Don Mattera and the likes of Mzwakhe Mbuli and Keorapetse Gkositsile.ù.His first book Through The Tunnel released in 2010 not only received exceptional reviews but was also internationally recognized. He went on to publish a literary study of Omoseye Bolaji that same year which as well was well received by literary pundits, newspapers and numerous other local publications. The successes of both books resulted in him being awarded the Free State Writer of the Year award in 2010 in addition to the Free State Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation purchasing his works for libraries across the province.Hector, who additionally serves as a Manager at SAA's Airchef's division, was also billed to perform at the Howick Writers Festival in Durban and was honored by Darrel David for Midland Literary Festival and Boekbedonner in the Karoo to name but a few. With a third book in the pipeline, the literary prot√©g√© is bound to receive further acclaim.The rising star, who has even learnt other languages in order to resonate with his audiences, sites Dr. Don Mattera, Keorapetse Gkositsile, Napo Mashiane, Jah Rose, Lebo Mashile, Gcina Mhlophe and QwaQwa native Kwazi as his sources of inspiration.His unique traditional poetry style laced with inspirational spiritual messages has undoubtedly endeared him in the hearts of his followers. .úThis is what I live to do. I worship God with poetry. I long to see the church appreciating God in Poetry. I yearn to see young children play in the rain singing .òRe Ne Sa Pula'.

Ngoba ngiyamazi owangichithela elakhe igazi kuze ngizazi!, I am not falling apart
But I art, with my start
Bleeding the end in my mind
Thus I bind no kind mind that perpetrates virtue
What is false compared to what is true has a sense of concrete value
But the truths always diminish or vanish lies with or without a clue!
I stand for the truth we all ought to die for, but cowards will rather accept bribes
Get stabbed in your back by the one you claim to trust
Have I got your head nodding?
These things happen, thus we sometimes see you fall apart!
But the art that makes you stand will get you standing and understanding
Why things fall apart, but the great art is to rise from the ash and pave your dash!
For I stand for the truth that cowards will sell for bread, even when I'm dead!, Translation, This poem is an ode to greats that have questioned societal norms. The poets speaks about Chinua Achebe .ì an African literary hero, Steve Biko .ì an anti-apartheid activist in South Africa.  He calls for this current generation to stand up for their believes the way these veterans did. Stylistically, the poet  uses a lot of Zulu click sounds to play with words poetically .ì a style he is known for."

Ever since 2009 Rediet was actively participating and presenting her poems at different cultural, poetic and book inaugural events. In 2015 Rediet published her first book along with 4 other poets titled <strong>Meskel Adebabay.</strong>
",Ethiopia,"This is a love poem about two people with two very different backgrounds who are trying to find common ground to plant their love. The poet likens the one lover to the English alphabet and the other to the Geez Amharic alphabet, both these languages have their beauty and complexities, but how will these two lovers combine the two to make a love language accessible to them both? The poem is dramatic, and filled with descriptive and sophisticated language."

They find him dangling from the roof like Michelangelo painting The Last Judgment on the ceiling of the Sistine chapel in Rome in 1510. Those years before hanging himself are reflections of a gray surface he was trying to obey. All he wants to do is obey. All he wants to say is goodbye., It is the 12th of August. The rains fall heavy, and the ground soaks wet. There is mud everywhere, and those who are anxious are planting maize, and flowers, and by now the earth has waited so long in thirst, there are cracks along it's lips that are now sipping in the falling rain. Something else falls too., The grasshoppers are falling. They are falling all night, and they are still all day long. In the damp corners of the wall they hide all day, praying. More grasshoppers fall, and they are changing color. At first they were green, and now they are tinting red. Why are they so angry? The girls ask. This is what they do in August. The girls wait for the grasshoppers to fall. Green ones don't bite. Brown ones are all friendly, and the reddish ones are the favorites., The red ones bite. So they are the ones we should pet. The girls remove the hind legs and pet the grasshopper's wings. It can't fly now, except if it found a way of jumping off a table's edge. Which is unlikely because her magnified eyes are watching the red one's every move. It was here in this reddish moment that he hung himself. It was raining, and there was mud everywhere. The news came through the wire, and from all over the people came., Inside, he dangles from the roof. He is taken down like an art piece of the early 20th century. He is a sack of meat, gone cold and stiff. There is a gray everywhere in the room, but this moment is too complicated for them to comprehend.¶, God is one. There is only one God and Mohammed is his messenger. God is one. There is only one God whose prophet is Mohammed, the beloved. There is one God. They are chanting at the burial grounds. On this particular occasion there has been an intermission. Not only are the red ones falling, he has committed suicide and must be canned., The corpse is laid on a flat bed. The bamboo is raised in the air, and the Ancestor holding his breath, shouts, and one through twenty. It lands on the dead buttocks and vibrates on the lifeless cheeks of suicide. They are caining him because he must be cained. After all, his chastened body will not feel a thing. We will not pray for him."

Confront our struggles with ink,
these pens are passive
Natural born peace makers
The train of war is passing,
crawling, forward in reverse
Time is of the essence
Minutes before birth
We're told that second(s), come first , These hours, aren't ours
before the soil grew lies
we invested in seeds
Planted our dreams,
Watered with efforts from ancestral streams
Sweat on soil, sunlit, we beam
But still,
These hours aren't ours
Before four
Before .úquarter to five.ù
Before six o'clock on the dot
Before the wise men came with clocks
The moon had long been our clock
And she is wise
The position of the sun told us time
But time has told,
we ought to reposition the mind,
of the Son, Black is bright
Black accommodates light
Our dreams are stars
And black is night
Black is life
Black is triumph
Black is right
Write us on time's hand
Eternity will lead us back to our future
Black to our origin
We know our genesis
In exodus we spoke in a language of time
Though history holds us hostage
We host age in young and vibrant veins
Our mouths are caves
Tongues are blades
Stabbing history hoping it bleeds our tales
500 years,
All we've mastered is being slaves
Same scenes, different timelines like d√©j√† vu
Sometimes, when days are dark, friends are few
Most times, when friends are dark; days are few.¶"

Style strait sweet loco
He has a way with word
I call him most delicious lover
While other words slip from my tongue like azucar
I have to be careful to take him in small doses
Not to overdose on sweetness so potent
He is fly
As birds in V formation heading south seeking sun
As Amazonian passeros passing over wilderness
Wild
He makes me open as Pacific Ocean
I was born to swim these waters
He tantalizes my senses with Latino tongue
Making even mundane words sound sexy like candado
Seriously it means padlock
I walk in trance locked on him
Palms interlaced
He is too smooth
I sip off him during droughts of freshness
He tastes like tomorrow
His eyes envelop tears
I watch them drip silently
Pain does not translate into vocabulary
Even for the best of poets
Some things can not be said
Like what it feels like when someone you love takes their own life
You live today to save what remains from being lost forever
Your life becomes their legacy
And EP for eternal memory
A vinyl
This is real
This right here..
Is real."
"Born in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria .ò1984, Inua Ellams is a Word and Graphic Artist, a writer with a style as influenced by Classic literature as it is by hip hop, by Keats as it is by MosDef. Rooted in a love for rhythm and language, he crosses 18th century romanticism & traditional story telling with contemporary diction, loose rhythm and rhyme. However, his first love was visual art; the first time he toyed with a pencil, he fell for the magic of line and form. He works extensively as a graphic designer / visual artist and also tries to mix the old with the new juxtaposing texture and pigment with flat shades of color and digitally created designs. He works in online and print.",United Kingdom,"One life.
(for Matthew, Eska and the Choir)
In a farm in Mexico, a grain of corn
is armed with faith. Half covered with soil
it trusts the wind will guide it water, waits
as sunlight plaits itself into photosynthesis,
germinates and listens for the world's pay.
Words play out. Two men squabble over
price, harsh language like rubble tongue-
tumbles, the argument bursts, bullets pop
like corn till blood waters the soil.
Worms wade in the reddened wet earth.
A sudden shadow. A swallow swoops.
Blood speckles the beaks of birds,
they feed their young who grow now,
towing this murder's song that's chirped
from spring to summer long.
One hundred people learn this wrong,
so speak yesses like locust swarm, ask
that changes come. But cameras only turn
for the spectacle of spectacle, nothing
of great importance comes, nothing
for the fallen ones who subtract
from tolerance, add to outrage.
Simple maths gets harder with age;
multiply hand-grenades with an album full
of families, the sky by missiles, the ground
by death, divide by oil flares and it'll equal
this: where charged hearts lead to fahrenheits
in foreign heights, chains to blindfolds,
hoods to shackles, light turns to a torturous
thing that burns memory, blackens thought,
churns to a vengeful melting pot.
What becomes us when peace is scarred,
compassion is barred and simple as
to love is hard?
Yet love makes strong.
It comes even in the murder song,
we breathe it in mouth-fulls, filter out with
lungs, a finer gust we trust to blow long,
that whiles by silent, whooshes by wrongs
swells and falls in this chimera of a poem
formed where condom rappers split, Haiti
burns, someone scarpers, a match box
rattles by Downing St. A gossip magazine
rustles rubbish, an alarm blips, two lovers
grip, an orchestra plays a song of soiled
strings, a choir outcries, a fat lady sings.
Against these unordered odds, one wish
drives us all, the only one that's ever been,
the hope, that through these torrid things
against such careless hate and hostiles,
a new born braves for a borderless world;
and one life wins."

As I pass the spoilt delinquency
my ears are alerted
the words sound perverted
my mind feels deserted
my heart seeks an aversion,
.úNigga, you gay!.ù
Yeah, I'm sure they are just playing
and those are words you would find me saying,
but they can't be over thirteen
and yes, I might be making a big deal
about an issue that to most is not for real
but I am convinced he don't know what it means
and if he does
it is a media definition of the word nigger
and of the word gay.
Now he has taken an ancestral slave
made him gay
in an offensive way
then directed it at a schoolmate
and it just seems okay.
Then you wonder how a highschool ninja can infiltrate isgila and chop chop chop
without uk'feela., E mfwethu, the robot is red!  What, you wanna get dead?  It's all that shit in your head.  Who gives a fuck what that kid said?  He didn't even swear.  Okay, maybe the gay thing was a unfair.  I'd hate to be called a fag with a dick up his ass in front of a bitch with a hot ass.

Social misfits, who rift
Love hearts into bits
Lift up their egos
Boasting to be cheats
Falling for false things
Beasts swimming in rotten deeds
Evil bids covered neat
God we all need, Where are the men who purpose
Who take offence in the tag bad ass
Bad as their swollen souls may lack colours
Men, who stand for the right matters
Wouldn't kill
Just to make their bank accounts fatter
Men, who think before they flirt
Weigh before they follow young skimpy skirts
Confess the truth with no buts
Love the women they call sluts
Respect them for who they are
Not salivating for their big butts, Oh, where are the men!, Men, who purpose to chase God
See life beyond their smartphones and i-pods
Men, who will humble before they stumble
Seek the truths of life
Make the world tremble, Men, Where are the men
Who are just men
Meant to relent not to frets
Nor scared of the devil
With his shallow threats
I wonder what would happen
If God took away His breath
He wants His people back
So sad the world has got us all stuck"

Skeletons that I'm revealing
Skeletons that form the bonds of weakness that I am feeling
Skeletons that hold together all the flesh that I am filling
Into the body of my story and gives it meaning, Skeletons from battles fought in battle fields
And battles felt in body fluids
Anti body bodies body building
Fighting off what could have ruined
That which you call me
Because I would have been ruins and skeletons would have been
Oh me, Me oh skeletons,  Skeletons
Danger .úSikelemu.ù, Skeletons
Bones oh Skeleton
Skeleton speaking into microphone
Skeleton you  Or skeleton me
Oh skeleton, I don't mean to scare you and your scared little ones
But we are just skeletons
Waiting to die and dry up and be dry bones
Dry skeletons
So instead of just being dry skeletons
lets leave our footprints on the concrete floor, Like the valley of the dry bones
By-gones  are not by-gones
but by-gones come back together like Ezekiel's dry bones
By gones come back together like Mbuya Nehanda's Dry bones
so Guns can spray like an insect spray called Baygon
but by God no gun can shot down my word
coz my word is my foot print
so here come my word, I wonder how long it will take us to open our eyes and see
I wonder when we are going to wake up  and break out
be the Micheal Schorefields and be free
The what , the who , the when and the how
The how the who the when and the what
The dreams of what Martin Luther Junior wanted
The same Dreams of Josiah Magama Tongogara, To be living in a World of Peace
where we Share Equally.¶
.¶Each Piece so each of us gets an equal piece
The kind of world that we are living in a world like this
Every nation is a gangster
and he has a piece (Gun), So if he ever gets Pissed off
Click-click .úpop.ù
First fight with pistols and then we talk peace talks , peace agreements on a piece of paper
For a piece of paper
Called paper paper, money money,
Paper money stash
Spilling the blood of the innocent being equivalent to cash
First world governments of ignorance with policies of trash
Build it up to break it down to build and start afresh
This is hogwash , childish, kindergarten , cr√ãche
Because War  is something that peace cannot address, Because Peace on its own is a phase between wars
Just like the First world
Peace came in between then there was bigger
Second World War
Where nuclear bombs had to blow
So peace on its own is not enough
What we need is Peace, Harmony and Love, So that at least when we bury these skeletons
they will be skeletons resting in peace"

find patience to sane me to Godly harmony,

into the careless air. This is not the world, I'd hoped it could be. It is horrible,
the way we carry on. Last night, you catalogued, our arsenal. You taught me devastation
is a goal we announce in a celebration, of shrapnel. Our bombs shower
in anticipation of their marks. You said this, is to assure damage will be widely distributed.
What gruesome genius invents our brutal hearts?, When you touch me I am a stalk of green panic
and desire. Wait here while I decide which, of these sprigs of blossoming heartbreak I can afford
to bring into my home. Tonight dreams will erupt, in chaotic buds of flame. This is the world we have

That philosophy has never changed and many of my poems and songs reflect this burning desire and mission to spread peace, love and unity through my art.ù, Mama C reflects. .úThe spontaneous release of love that comes from poetry and music and art, in general.¶ that thing that binds us all together and builds solidarity and understanding among all people no matter where they are from or what language they speak, is like magic!.ùHer song writing and performing talents have been showcased on stage, television and radio in many cities in Africa and in America during the annual UAACC Heal the Community Tour.

damp
faded

hot tears of fear and shame
that fall in vain
from the eyes of those mamas
who wring life's dirty water out of kanga cloth
again and again and again, I'm talking 'bout the old ones
those kanga cloths that serve as recycled nappy wear
Those once new
NOW unraveling kanga cloths
whose softness helps soothe cries of babies dear
who valiantly resist .†brush and comb through .†tangled matted hair
that was quickly dried by sweet smelling kanga cloth
that had been freely blowing in the wind
fascinating the gaze of the child left alone
while mama is forced to earn a few shillings here and there

that's been sloshed on the bar floor by men who grin
and rip at the old kanga cloth that she wears, It's that same kanga that she used to wipe the uji
from the face of her baby boy just the morning before
It's that same kanga that she'll use to fill up the cracks
.†at the bottom of her termite bitten door
It's that same kanga she'll use to rock
her now full bellied baby to sleep
that same kanga whose faded colors
.†drain hope from her sometimes sunken
dried out checks
BUT.¶
is that the SAME.¶
that same kanga that I now see fluttering lightly
in the afternoon breeze?
is that possibly that same kanga that she now clings to
that helps lift her up
from bruised and scratched up knees?
is that the same kanga cloth hanging from her shoulders
that her neighbors now wrap tightly round her,
as they assure her that
they got her back
.†as if she was their own son or their own grown up daughter?
is that the same kanga cloth whose faded colors look suddenly bright and new
with almost delirious hope
with full blown courage
with unity
and with community love now fully renewed?
is that the same old worn out kanga cloth that previously was full of pitiful holes
somehow NOW tightly woven with tears dried and peeled off
like new mottled skin of a life feeling fulfilled and bold!
is that the same old kanga cloth that she used to wear before
that now wipes up those gurgles of joy that drip from the laughing face of her full bellied boy!
is that the same kanga cloth that mama now wraps round her head
as she .†lifts up her smiling face to the sun
NOW
with pride
as she strides with new found courage ahead
into new opportunities
no more skinned knees√ñno more pitiful woe!
A NEW WOMAN!
A NEW MAMA!
with her dreams and her hopes wrapped in a bright kanga rainbow!"

And know this,

No matter where or from whom it beats;
Joy and Sorrow
Pain and Pleasure
Are  felt in equal measure
In every heart
None the better
None the worse.

Over time
Across time
Within time
There is nothing new
Under the sun
Save different paths
To a universal destination.
There is no song
That has never been sung,
No poem that has never been written,
No thought that has never been thought,
No emotion that has never been felt.
You are no more special
Or no less worse
Than those who walked this earth
Before you
Those who still walk it
And those who will walk it
After you.
Therefore do not take too much pride in your success
Do not blame yourself too much for your failures
Laugh when there is joy
Cry when there is pain
And just live, in-between., And in living, Understand this,
Do not wait for the Salvation
Because you are the Saviour,
Do not wait for the Redemption
Because you are the Redeemer,
Do not wait for the Revolution
Because you are the Revolutionary,
Do not wait for the Inspiration
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE INSPIRER., The destination is where we began."

"Chris Mann, a South African of English, Dutch and Irish descent, was born in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. He started his working life in rural development and poverty alleviation projects, such as low-cost water-supply and sanitation, small-scale agriculture and labour-intensive public works including secondary road and pipeline construction. This multi-faceted, multi-talented writer has also taught English in a rural school, lectured in English at Rhodes University and worked in teacher development and job creation. He has volunteered for various trusts, has been a parish councillor and was a founder and song-writer of Zabalaza, a cross-culture band performing in English and Zulu.His formal education includes a BA from Wits majoring in English and Philosophy, an MA from the School of Oriental and African Languages (London) in African Oral Literature and an MA from Oxford in English Language and Literature. Now based at the Institute for the Study of English in Africa at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, he is the founder and convenor of Wordfest, a national multilingual festival of South African languages and literatures with a developmental emphasis. Chris Mann's poems have appeared in a wide range of journals, textbooks and anthologies in South Africa and abroad. He performs his work at various festivals, schools, churches, universities and conferences around the country as part of a life-long passion to promote poetry in the public domain. Able to converse in Afrikaans, Zulu and Xhosa, Mann writes poetry influenced by the richness of the different languages he speaks and which reflects the diverse work experiences and social encounters he has had. Keenly narrative, his poems convey to the reader the textural details of the South African landscape and the intimacy of its people. As he examines his own spirituality, which appears rooted in the history, place and potential that is contemporary South Africa, his practical musicianship emerges clearly in the lilting lyricism and rhythm of his poetry.",South Africa,"We do not see deeply unless with love
and deepest and clearest among our insights
are those which steeped in love's energy
accumulate clarity in contemplative calm., Such brooding serenity allows the self
to convene the shades alive in the soul,
to quieten the bombastic, hearten the shy
and bid the elderly and neglected speak. , In turn, these partners and companions,
mentors, opponents and even enemies
converse with each other and the self,
which listens, responds and negotiates., This reconciliation, of shades and self,
flows on and separates and flows again
in sleep and dream as well as in thought,
with balance and not perfection its goal., Democracy will always be shallow
until it's ensconced within our souls.
We cannot make peace with each other
until we make peace with our shades."

",United States,"Have you ever
had to defend your existence
to your white friends and family
who call you militant,
thinking it's only Black folks
you can see?, Colorblinded cheerleaders
shouting
see people as humans,
never as skin tone.¶
I mean Barack Obama made it
besides slavery's been gone, Fear flashes in their eyes
as my voice begins to rise
saying
where I stand today is a long way
from the fairytale innocence of my youth
believing the United States
must be synonymous
with freedom democracy truth
you see,
slavery today we know
by another name
prisons have become industries
producing Black and Brown bodies
enchained, I spent fourteen years
in Catholics schools
hearing about the glory of heaven
when God's love and goodness will prevail
but now I question the value
to suffer, suffer for world
with so many trapped on earth
inside this living hell, My education took me beyond
the mental confines of textbooks
bound with lies
causing my innocent mind
to contemplate the state
of other folks' demise
like.¶, How come my friends
in the public schools
got 30 year old textbooks
and I'm the only one
from my block today
who made it out of the town
while they're still
pregnant
in jail
or jobless
yet everyone from the Catholic school
was college bound?, Why do white folks tell me
I don't act Black
if it ain't about race
then call me their best friend
but tell nigger jokes to my face?, What's the basis of all this
if Abe Lincoln apparently set us free?, How can they call themselves Christians
yet claim their god
could never look like me
blasting hip hop
in brand new cars
throwing private parties in mansions
praying for god to bless the poor
while adopting conservative republican stances, I'm so confused
by all these contradictions
can't someone please make it clear
why in 2014
I still have to live my life in fear
not knowing whether each time
I leave the house
might be my last
because trigger-happy cops
call me suspicious
then blast, The media portrays us as:
criminals
uneducated thugs
burdens to society
that only make babies
and sell drugs, If Barack Obama made it
why are my sisters and brothers burning
in the flames
of a nightmarish American Dream
that just sounds deranged
compared to the inequality I see
every single day.ì
this world leaves us so broken
is it any wonder
people kneel down to pray?, So, my family
if you truly want to love me
I have just two conditions:, First
recognize all the diversity
within human existence
simultaneously
we're all constructed
from the very same elements.¶, So what? You ask
and question my relevance, Second
accept that our collective humanities all intertwine
so my freedom's dependent on yours
yours dependent on mine  , That means as long as teary-eyed mothers
ride along with Black babies
in hearses
I'll continue to cry out for justice
in all of my verses."

covered your mother with a rough, grey blanket., I can't know what you know, how you really feel
I can only surmise from how I see you spend your days

busy, reading, preoccupied, thinking, dreaming.
But if you wanted to say something more to me
than paint colour, OSB, plywood, pergola, mast, tiller

I would listen., Except, this is the way you talk to me of what is in your heart.

"Collin the Bushman is an Attaqua bushman from a town called Dysselsdorp, on the outskirts of Oudsthoorn. He grew up in the Boland, Worcester area.A poet, artist, bushman-blues/folk singer and musician, he is passionate about what he does. Part of his journey has been to rediscover his Khoikhoi roots. Living in a culturally diverse South Africa has inspired Collin to theme his work under the bushman heritage and culture.Collin has been in the music and poetry industry since 1995. He started out in the hip-hop scene with the help of Black noise, P.O.C, Brasse van die Kaap, and Hip crew. He started out as a B- boy/MC, the culture of self-expression through music & art really inspired Collin to voice issues that were and are still relevant today. The issues addressed in his music & poetry are mostly around cultural & community awareness.In 2011 Collin met up with rapper/artist/performer Jitsvinger, which led him to also working with the great spirit Jethro Louw aka Tannaman !xam. Combining his work with Jitsvinger and Jethro really took the poetry to a whole new level of Khoikhoi-culture awareness.",South Africa,"It is the dawn of a new day
Where the cock crows melodies
that echoes harmonies over landscapes.
Where the eland stampedes rhythms
An ancient African heartbeat
That transcends out of a sub-Saharan divinity
It clicks at the oral traditions of time
Spirit that calls and
That speaks loud at the ears of ignorance, Tracking and repatriating the descent of the sun
Preserving what's left,
a few more than just sticks and stones
Broken bows and arrows, clay pots and cells
And the stories that the tell without knowledge of self
It is just empty chance of long forgotten heroes
And those foes who stood up going down the river blues, Preserving the ruins of a tantalised culture
A distorted taste of intellectual development
In a desolated time and space
Captured and stripped naked
By the hands of the hatred who came
to annihilate the pride of the sacred
Dancing under blood set moonview
Rhythmic watchmen, ancient bushmen
Fostering the ruins and scatterings of my piece of history?
Being played and painted on a canvas of prejudice?
Portraying the social scales,
it is ten thousand to one?
But how can the heavens be shut for the tribesman
The holies of holies be forbidden for, For the San, say the sun is watchman
on the walls spotting the invader,
the disturbers of the peace
But like the pen of a skilful writer
The brush still strokes silhouettes of quantum expressness
On a stony canvas on a cave near Tolsriver in Ceres
Writings of the San in the sand
Preserving the origins of a most original man
Time got involved with space
And gave birth to the clans

Some MFA workshop professor chose to reply
To a question about a draft by calling her
A nigger.îI use the word he chose.î
Then showing her and the other black poet there
The door. This happened when she was young.
What is it now? A shell, dripped like lacquer on her skin?
A splinter, stuck between vein and bone?, We re-taste his poison
In her voice. Poison that doesn't kill you
Is still poison, even in a room filled with trust., And her story is now our story
And also yours.
If her tormentor could see the ways we will
Survive this
He would burst into bloom."

but I cannot remain
to enjoy the samosas and the designer water, I must be stalking

with the arrow's notch I will straddle the string, is it up that I must point?
do I aim at the floor?
must I swing with the loaded shaft
to the door?
to the window?
to the facelessness of the wall?, the time is coming
to make a departure
but when is that moment?
can it be the top of the morning?
shall it be the mid of the day?
will it be lapped round
with a kaross of small hours?, I load my brain
with all manner of images
this chamber and that, the whole planet is spinning
this is sharper than science
input derives from a gut under tension
my bladder is full, brought up with fixed categories
I have fixated for years upon Europe
I am dancing now with Africa, place of my birth
who claimed me before I knew, is the place not opportune?
can the moment not be prescient?

.úcome come come,.ù yell the folks, there is a twang of release

To be released from the prison
That he fashioned for my bondage
After illegally occupying the mansion that houses my spirit
He would go about desecrating my temple
Profaning the sacredness of my body's internal
Abusing my vessel
Blocking my channel to the light at the end of the tunnel
Keeping me in darkness
Emphasizing my weakness/flaunting his mistress
Damaging my esteem and my being to the point
That I felt powerless
In the name of love I let myself be violated by a narcissist
A terrorist in romantic disguise
He would constantly bomb my body and attack my mind
He would offer me up as a ritual sacrifice at the altar of his ego
To make himself feel macho
Bombing my body/attacking my mind
He waged an unholy war/on everything my womanhood stood for
He was obviously on a mission to reduce me to rubble
Using supreme cruelty and extreme brutality
To induce me to crumble
Sometimes his tactics were subtle
But always designed to leave me feeling very unstable
It was exploitation at the highest level
But it was only possible as long as I stayed ignorant
So it's no surprise the day this sister achieved enlightenment
Was the same day I began to see visions of freedom
To imagine the reality of a life free from his torture
Daydreams of reclaiming my stolen royalty
Loving myself in totality
Erasing his mistreatment of my beauty
from the sanctuary of memory
Celebrating the infinite power of me
Now strong enough to defend myself from any future attacks of the enemy
Because all I want is to be free
The liberation of me"

All that life: from first rank beginnings in the earth,
something stirred in matter; there emerged a drive
to animate the dirt .ì Surprise! .ì a brief ellipse called
life the breath arrived, then came the certain slide, back to sludge. A trick, endlessly repeated. Generations rise,
act, expire. The mud is packed with death. Again, the new
recurs: hopeful twigs root the sky, quick fish swarm beneath
swirls of birds migrating to merge with landscape. None, can escape the loop. Sprigs and wriggling nematodes
lift inspired shapes to glance above the mulch derived
from those who went before       then die       Layers of
life rest limp and crushed beneath the holy stone of time,, hidden from the spinning crazy round of sun and moon,
and left fermenting inside the warm barrel of the earth., 2. All that pain: the bloody, hacked-off limbs of war; those injuries
a lover's heart sustains. Lives stocked with hardened grudge
or slow-cooked revenge. The bludgeon of recurrent thought,
or fuzz of the drug-smudged brain. The push towards, those things we love, and would not lose: an early lily, lush
in bloom; brass ensembles filling sun-bronzed rooms; a child
immersed, creating nests away from harm in long bush grass.
All this richness soon will pass, be lost, is already past, has gone., The screw rotates again; with each turn the living thread goes
underground. All vital cells, all life's vast loveliness, and all vile
anguish, is delivered back to silence, to rot, to fertilize the next
round of intrepid roots and sprouts, fiery heart- and limb-buds., Sometimes, the aftermath of life sinks deeper into soil; lakes of slow
decay compose     thick cuds of sleep     and the dark prayer of oil."

",South Africa,"They are telling tales of you in Spanish
on both sides of the Atlantic.
On Facebook you have written up a small legend
of your time in Buenos Aires.
Your tattoo, the tango championships,
your appearance on Rock &amp; Pop FM.
A ring for every finger in the street markets.
Strolling under the gaze of the pink house of parliament,
its rose-coloured colonnades once tinted with the blood of an ox., In Grahamstown the taps went dry for four entire days.
The townsfolk were dirty and mad.
The police brought helmets, shields, and a water cannon
to the protest.
In the crowd, one woman suggested inciting a riot,
just to get a shot at the water., Each day there is only air in the pipes.
How strange, that the absence of water
should sound so like an ocean.
The suck and hiss on a line
as the phone connects across acres of sea., At dawn I carry buckets from the rain tank.
Warm three large pots on the stove,
squat in the bath like a frog,
and toss them, methodically, over my head.
Wet.
Soap.
Rinse., My life has made me an artist of bucket baths.
Of making the most of very little.
But how I curse the brevity of connection
when all the modest pots of it are done., As I turn again from chopping board
to empty tap to rinse my hands,
I think of reaching for yours.
And ponder how it is that water is like love., We are drenched in it. Steeped.
We play with it, waste it.
An outage brings a reckoning with need.
How deep and vast and recurrent it is., I know, I know, even now we are connected,
an ocean holds our continents in the crook of each arm.
But I am listening for water in the pipes.
I want to hear the sound of it
gurgling closer to home., I want to bathe again,
to wallow and luxuriate,
run its little rivulets into all the hollow places,
connect with every inch of my skin., From my crown top
down
to each
of my
toes."

Ningobani bakwa bani abazalwa ngoban' (x3), We lace every vowel with a click/ so when we speak the bowels of the earth may relate/ and reverberate in thunder./ Under the rule of devine inspiration/ we find inclination to break out in song/ so long as the jembe beat goes (*singing the hook once*) ON!/ Dawn turns to dusk/ as we unmask every idiom/ as a tedium of devotion / unlocking an ocean of meaning;/ leaning each on the other's/  understanding/ and finally lending upon the realisation/ that some information/ does not suffer translation with dignity.
Humanity contained in every anecdote/ we quote ancestors as yet unborn/ and mourn the death of yesterday's naievety/ when the liberty of oblivion departs from our souls' minds/ and winds the hands of time/ with each line- each verse-/ to reverse the flow of intellectual traffic/ from spiritual topics.
Dropping bombs of rhetoric,/ we obliterate the nucleus of the mind of the beast's seventh head./ Dead or alive, misconception's our target/ as we budget for a fair price/ and entice ice into admitting it's just frozen water.
Jah's chosen order/ knows no borders in times of truth;/ tooth decay/ the price we pay for chewing through candy-coated wood/ disguised as food for thought./ Not bulimic yet we expel false mythologies/ that retell past trilogies from the first person perspective/ of the collective while regurgitating/ and imitating the gospel of sanctimonious foreign idols/ armed with bibles whose dogma rivals the mysteries/ of our collective histories as a people of infinite worth/ who consummate birth through songs of praise/ and raise our spears up high/ when the tears we cry for our fallen warriors/ cannot carry us beyond our grief/ to relief/ as we accuse time of being a thief with no shame!
Name our children for the values we deem most precious in our searches for perfection/ under the protection of this or that holy diety/ whose piety grants us these lessons/ and blessings.
Persons of royal decent,/ we've spent light years chasing the moon/ at noon. Night fears the sun/ so we connect one -by- one/ fact-by-fact/ and in effect eclipse/ with our lips those words which imprison/ our powers of reason,/ teasing the sky into a change of season.
Peas in a pod,/ God and I converse/ and confess our dreams/ till it seems we share the same pillow./ Willow trees and I relate when the wind blows through my hair/ to soothe my head through these harsh rays of light as I fight and sometimes fail/ through these pale images in my head/ like a mad creature.
I've bled; sutured my flesh/ only to catch myself/ about to scratch afresh just after time heals all wounds.
Tunes and melodies/ are remedies received as grace/ from the same place where we were conceived/ before our need/-no, make that our greed-/ for material sensation/ outdid self- realisation and forced us/ to devorce/ the source and travel to this plane.
We remain connected to the Milk Way/ and many say/ we play bigger than our minds/ when signs of our divinity surface/ despite the burning/ furnace of yearning/ turning us into addicts/ of conflicts with fate.
Wait till you see us rise/ and the size/ of your eyes/ will quadruple in surprise.¶
Cos we are/ spectacular/ in every vernacular/ blood thicker than Count Dracula could ever sip!
We trip on heart-lines/ and art finds the voice to declare:/ .úNGIMUHLE!.ù/ Yeah,/ clear as crystal/ my sister, our spirits/ will it so a new day is near.
Oh let's wear our faith on our sleeve/ and believe every morning/ is worth atoning for the sins/ our skins have not yet committed!
Constricted by the shackles of our past,/ our battles often last beyond/ the end of time/ but I'm certain this/ is the path to inner peace.¶./ coz.¶in a piece I wrote before they declared/ me dead-oddly I still recall/ with no trouble at all-/ the last verse read:/ .úHad you any/ before the first penny,/ many would've been the holes/ in you soul's pocket.ù

",Ethiopia,"This is a powerful poem, about a man trapped in dreaming and contemplation of his future. The poet makes an exceptional use of imageries to explain this man's state of mind but also his environment. The man is day-dreaming and plotting towards his grand ambitions by the cool waters of the Blue Nile gorge. The poet's strong writing skills are demonstrated in the ways he uses the interplay and mix of words to draw attention to the complexity and deliberateness of the man's thought process."

Heart pounding, mouth dry
I close my eyes and will my tears to flow
A floodgate of memory of humiliation,
Mine, hers, ours!, Whack!
Another lash, harsher than the previous
A sound I can no longer bear to hear
In a furor of action I mingle, angry
No longer stupefied!, Whack!
Tables turn a switch grabbed and flung at him
It misses!
Rancor settles at the sound of her voice
No more.¶, A shudder.¶
Inexplicable sense of guilt
All this cruelty as punishment
For the most natural of all emotions
And we let it happen?, Frustrated.¶
Teeth clenched we claw and rake
Root it out we call and sing together
As we match and stamp and shake.¶

Pride plummeted.¶

At the dawn of an era alien to him."

As she thrust her body to the wind, leaping from a 10 story building
In reach of her scorned heart splattered all over the concrete ground, Gravity be still., He promised me everlasting Love, So I opened my thighs and he built his home in my womb,
planted his seed, breaking the seal that protected my vulnerability., He promised me everlasting Love So I gave him the keys to the realm of my heart,
And like a thief, he took with no remorse, stole my pride and self-esteem
I even gave up church for Him., He promised me everlasting love so, I dropped out of school,
I had a man whose pockets were as deep as the bank, Man this guy was cool, Mother cried and begged, so I packed my bags for in my mind I knew better than her, He promised me everlasting love, A baby on my back, hungry and weak and a diaper full of crap,
No job, no qualification
A Positive HIV status is what got me addicted to crack, How can Life be so cruel?, Standing on the roof top looking down, I saw a reflection of myself
I tried to reach out but the wind carried me,
My heart cried out for help,
in hope that he'd catch me as I fell., My spirit broke from the flesh and it was free
Until Hell opened up and swallowed it in., Gravity be still"

"Dikson has been performing spoken word since 2006 when his virgin outing saw him qualify as the youngest competitor in the semi-finals of the UK-wide BBC Radio 4 poetry slam. Now based in Zimbabwe the artist has organised festival events, worked with youth on varied projects and performed across Europe and Southern Africa. His poetry has been translated into German and Danish. Dikson has performed on numerous occasions in Zimbabwe and South Africa including a feature performance at the renowned Poetry Africa Festival. He has also performed in Germany, Norway and Denmark as part of two separate tours. He has collaborated with artists from the US, England, Norway and Botswana and has been a part of jazz-fusion acts, electronic and poetic fusions. He has conducted workshops for disadvantaged youth in Zimbabwe and in schools in South Africa, Norway and Denmark.He is the workshops, conferences and exhibitions manager for Zimbabwe's fastest growing international festival, Shoko. The focus of the festival is on empowering urban youth and culture by providing a platform for urban art forms and artists. Hip-hop and spoken word is at the nucleus of this festival where local artists collaborate with international artists from around the world. In the past they have had Natty (UK) perform and conduct workshops, Akala (UK) collaborate with local artists and share the similarities between hip-hop and Shakespeare in the workshop programme, Tumi and the Volume (SA) perform and conduct song-writing workshops, amongst many others from Germany, the US, Botswana and Kenya. This involves a close working relationship with international artists and ensuring that their needs are met: the practicalities of transport, accommodation, fees, budgeting and itinerary as well as providing them with ample information, being flexible when it comes to their creative wishes and reliable throughout the tour.Zimbabwe's most well known festival, HIFA has also recruited the artist and organiser for the last few years as both the Youth Zone consultant and the Workshops and Masterclasses consultant. As the latter he had to create and co-ordinate a programme that included 22 public workshops for adults and youth as well as a master class programme that involved over 30 international artists from Africa, Europe, the US and Australia that spanned the week of the festival. He was responsible for liaising with the artists and finalising the content of each workshop.Dikson placed a heavy emphasis on cultural exchange and created an innovative selection of workshops that were collaboratively run by local and international artists. In this way they were able to fuse different styles and sounds.Dikson is also the editor and creative director of the Zimbabwean youth platform, Kalabash. The website was launched in mid-May of 2013 and has become the country's leading youth opinion site. His role has been to direct young writers from around the country to come up with content on arts, culture, society and politics. Either in the office or through online correspondence he has mentored and urged them to break the boundaries of archaic writing styles and approaches. Through workshops he has encouraged young contributors to explore different media such as film, audio and photography to capture their Zimbabwe. The site has also been selected as one of the eighteen winners of the World Summit Youth Awards out of over 400 applicants.Aside from this Dikson is also a staff writer for the US-based travel and culture site, Matador.

Sends shivers down his crooked spine when he thinks back to the time before the time before time when they were close,
Shared dreams like yin and yang tagged over with a smiley,
A delicate balance of beliefs snapped with the kind of divine carelessness that turns people into salt and runs blood through drainpipes,
The wishbone splintered halfway between the flames of hell and its smoke that billows in the sky, the place where angels reside,
He used to be part of this holy trinity passing spliffs and prophecies around a round table slouched back in his chair leaning on the weakest leg hoping that maybe he might fall and lighten the mood, let me introduce.¶limbo the clown,, He found deep pockets of inspiration in the lining of his hand-stitched, patchwork and polka dot baby-grow suit,
Colour was his thing, bright colour, slapdash face paint showed how wide his lips would smile if they could
And tears forming blue pearls in the place where eyelids touch hadn't met sadness, their creator was the unashamed joy that respawns them in the split seconds that make up 7 days.¶
He knew not what they said about guys with big shoes scuffed on sandy pilgrimages through time and space shepherding the essence of his beliefs
But his technicolour crown birthed a burning bush of coiled hair and gave him the idea to create slinkys on the day that god rested,
It was the same day he made dodo birds, dinosaurs, funny bones and wished the Irish good luck,
His breast pocket was where he kept his rainbows and confetti, ready to add a splash of colour to dimly lit moments,
Baggy sleeves left room for his trickery to breathe through the gills in his needlework
And caution to the wind allowed the sun to give his nose a rosy glow on the days he spent marvelling at what his mother had created.¶, .¶Around the time we switched the letters A. and D. and B. and C. and started counting numbers he was giving Jesus tips on party tricks like turning water into wine and telling the devil to play dead to see if the world remembered how to say his name,
On days when preaching took place he'd burn effigies of anything, dance like the possessed and speak human to human about how some things are too big to describe so just trust your eyes and whatever it is that makes you smile,
He'd carve animals out of stone and watch happily as carnival kids walked around dragging these dusty figurines on the ground,
They were taught not to trust him but they didn't care, he wore a smile while their parents looked to god for punishment like masochistic children shaken by the unpredictability of freedom and the fear of what death might bring,
For him the blandness of purity and fables of the damned were too tame a thought, heaven offered him only white and hell the deepest black but he wanted colour because that's what he saw,
If this was a simple place where darkness stopped and daylight began like twilight wasn't worth witnessing then he wouldn't be here,
He wanted his story told but not in the scriptures by those who through divine pillow talk birth the ugly child he never saw,
No he planted his spirit in painted faces and the diversity of our fluorescent existence, so he keeps heaven and hell at an arms length, just close enough to humour himself with the fragility both and stay safe in the knowledge
That the most high, with his head in the clouds and his inbred, pyromaniac, red cousin with the horns, haven't visited this place in a long, long time,
And while the stitching in his patchwork might be fraying its fabric won't fade, and his face paint is resistant to moments when the heavens open,
He knows limbo doesn't exist between biblical lines but it's fine because he chose to fall back from his chair flinging cream-filled pies as he did towards the clouds landing face up on the ground, laughing uncontrollably at the irony of his banishment,
No longer would he be stuck in the middle of a chequered chessboard that entrances the colour-blind to believe
That in a place where life is as vivid as midnight rainbows
Anything could be as black and white as the time before the time before.¶time."

She was part of the cast of a workshopped theatrical poetry performance called Secret With the Moon; part of the Arts Alive festival (2013) and was invited to perform at the Melville poetry festival (2012). She has judged various poetry slams like Word n Sound (2014), Drama For Life, Lover and Another (2013) and has helped in preparing prolific, talented poets for the stage for Drama for Life (2014) by conducting workshops to observe and guide their performance technique and discuss and impart knowledge on the subject matter.ìsex and sexuality.

",South Africa,"ONE, Wake up
The night has run out of ink to plaster across the sky
The moon &amp; his mentor have swapped sides
Now; The light, TWO, Pee. Brush teeth. Shower.
Empty our bodies of yesterday's guests
The night is a writer
Cleanse yourself of her story
Wear glory on your back
Carry hunger to you quest for language and math and social science and health
Even if you're not sure you can, THREE, Scream. Duck. Wonder what happened now
How a morning so promised could be sold to terror
The chaos of noise with no source, disbelief with no voice, dust hovering, afraid to hit the floor
Because guns shattered the glossy facade of our normal, Our everyday has become a graveyard with cracked tombstones, unmarked
Abandoned by god's breath and sight
In our pajamas, in our morning stupor climbing over last night's empty beer cans and yesterday's laundry, today, we are tagged, marked for death
Never given the chance to denounce ourselves
These masked men who kill us for being mountains, murder fingerprints
Make mausoleums of our lecture theatres
And crypts of our temporary homes
We're here surviving wars that were never our own, FOUR, DO survive, If you can't, then plead with those who are alive
Tell them:
Please
Know us
We are histories. We have names and blood and beauty
Please
Avenge us
We are energy. We had plans and we spoke future into our actions
Futures shouldn't be snuffed out just like that, ended quite so easily
And, finally, Please
Don't sit waiting on the fence
The borders we've imagined aren't going to protect us
Don't do nothing while they're raiding your neighbour's house
Don't wait until they're breaking your backyard fence down, are standing in your kitchen, have poured themselves juice and are drinking from your glasses to say something
Act now, FIVE, Climb over the bodies of my friends
Leave them there

Larry Olomoofe, Visible Invisibility: Deconstructing the Hungarian Gaze, You despise me
before you know me,
recreate me as something of your own,
and don't stop to ask me.
I don't think, therefore
I'm some thing you can toy with.
I'm nothing, to be made some thing,
useful for you to examine, fill, classify.
You assume I am yours for the taking,
presume I was just waiting for you,
to make me mean something., Because I'm nothing you can name
I become nothing,
expire when you leave the scene,
a shadow cast from your light.
I'm nowhere, the edge of terra incognita.
I'm nothing, the unknown incarnate.
I'm nothing, your antithesis, your anti-Christ.
The chimera on the edge of your map,
something to be tamed, domesticated
and you call me Samboo., Because I'm nothing you can name
I scare you. You war against me,
decide I cannot live
As I lie down I slowly fade,
pine and expire, defaced and denied,
saddened and alone in your world., Because I'm nothing you can name,
I repeat my own names to myself .ì

my true-true names, with love., Because I'm nothing you can name,
I falter in my eyes. I peer at my reflection
at the quayside wondering
if my mother will recognize me?
Am I still my father's son?
Are my grandfathers ghosts?
Am I still alive at home?, Because I'm nothing you can name,
I no longer speak, my words senseless,
and you hear nothing. I swallow myself
whole, haunting my insides.
I look for a way out.

I am not wise, I have no answers and questions disappear.

Folks came here floating on a big plane or small boat.
From the banana republics and rainforest cafes,
saving up their little pay just to see some better days.
I am the first.
Born on to this land I navigate with ease,
for my parents sake I will survive by any means.
If that means physics, bio, calculus and chemistry.
These boring subjects encompass their every single dream.
At 15 I translate between the judge and the jury.
My teacher says I'm doing bad, I tell my dad not to worry,
plus I can't translate all the hate that she gives me.
Racist curriculum I'm not dumb and don't need your pity.
Maniacs rule your cities while geniuses drive your cabs.
And I've had to work twice as hard for every single thing that I've had.
From selling from my stash, trying to make that quick and easy cash.
Dead end jobs that can leave you dead on the job.
Poverty is like love, it makes you do some crazy things.
Like using a fake gun to stick up the stick up kids.
Babylon system leaving no options.
So it's get rich or die trying either that or just dying.
Or you work, and you work and you work for jerks.
Bosses who don't see people but see profits.
And not the holy kind, I'm talking dollar signs,
and I begin to see why poverty like love is blind.
Or maybe just colour blind?
A tiny inconvenient truth about labour groups,
and the masses of the working classes.
But then again some people say that race doesn't even exist.
Tell that to the trees still sore from hanging lynches.
But during this day and age,
we have fresh new waves of semi-paid slaves,
willing to work for less than our minimal wage.
And these foreigners don't understand these foreign concepts,
they thought they were Canadian, but slowly dismissed that nonsense.
And I hate to be the one to say it, but, I mean this is it.
This is your stinking land of dreams,
a place where  you can still live 3rd world in a first world country.
Love has cupid and poverty has stupid
This is a place where we can grow up to learn nothing about ourselves.
This is a place where they insist that sex should sell.
This a place where we can grow up to want the things we definitely do not need.
This is a place where your kids can become addicted to alcohol and weed.
And I bet they didn't tell you this on your immigration application.
Because sadly this may still be better than your former locations.
So if you won't say it, than I guess I'll have to say it for you,
besides I'm used to translating your dreams and hopes too.
Aside from on America's most wanted, we are not wanted, here.
Because my colour and last name still spark fear.
The same kind that can easily become violent.
And you can't be protected by studying science,
because even our nerds aren't good enough for them,
I was born here and I'm screwed, but you, you have an accent.
You get the same respect as fat kids in gym class,
first to get cut and always picked last.
But don't get mad, because you're doing the best that you can.
And I love you because you were not afraid to take a chance.
So the next time someone tells you to go back to where you came from,
tell them we should all go back, and finally let the natives have some fun.

And be who you want to be
My quest for perfection comes with zest and high maintenance
Today I made an entrance at the salon to wash my Nubian locks
They were shampooed through every interlaced follicle
Conditioned to the core
Gushed with warm water to open the pores
One by one, twisted with beeswax, from root to tip
The man said they looked good, I smiled and gave him a tip
Ready to shoot for the moon, I left the salon and took a left turn
Shortly after, a stranger pointed at me and gasped at a friend, .úLook, a rasta!.ù
He boxed me and my Nubian locks into a subculture without knowing other
Thus I spoke, .ú Brother, perhaps my hair is a repudiation of Eurocentric style, represented by straight hair, that which so many sisters wear and tear their scalps with sodium hydroxide, going outside of their budgets for impossible permanents and imported weaves, behold the deterrence.
Or perhaps my hair signifies creative self-expression, merely a construction of the psychological self. Behold I teach you the superman!'
Perplexity pained on their faces.¶ and then the one summed a bark at me, .úSome pot perhaps?.ù
Request or offer, it doesn't matter, he'd already fallen into the abyss.
Alas I looked in the mirror, the statement had to be clearer.
 I went back to the salon and asked for a fade, the kitchens were shed as he drew me a map at the edge of my dreads.  I dotted the i's, crossed the t's by trimming even the tips
Groomed and confident, I gave another tip, and exited right assured that this time I'd be delight
One man stopped me and asked, .úWhy do all of you guys wear dirty-rastas?.ù, he was de-lighted
Thus I spoke, .úBrother, if I were devoid of aesthetics I could be a sage, or a holy shaman, the master of fire, with a special karma relating with spirits between two worlds and ages.  Why strip me of aesthetics?? See this hint of red dye? I could be a warrior of the masaai tribe, a nomadic hunting and gathering type, taking great pride in my luscious locks.

Woven out of a thousand myths, anecdotes and detailed chapters,
The following words merely a page among the clutter: lack of hygiene having, dirty smelling, free forming nappy headed, reggae jamming, Ethiopia-Jamaican loving, ja worshipping, lyaric speaking, ganja smoking, vegan eating, anti-structural motherf****r!!
Despite the evidence of the senses contradicting these sentences, they feel safe sentencing Africa to a box, stacked on the surface
My cousin Sartre said it comes with the territory.
I did not want to accept this, yet I was crushed beyond measure
I walked with my tail between my legs.¶.
Until I saw a Nubean Queen with silver highlights
Irradiating past the constant noise
And behind her more locked brothers and sisters ambling with poise
A ray, I see the fact of dreadlocks in the corner
My faith renewed, the black tomorrow cannot borrow time, it cannot dawn today"

Is what I seek to give
Not the words from my mouth
But the breath that I live on
Touch my heart, my soul
You will find God's essence
Stuttering on the words of I and I
There is no doubt in my mind
Suffering malnutrition, ignorance , indecision, starvation is not the way
But our future is not rooted in
Silver and gold either
Neither is it in them
Fighting oppression suppressing
Borrowing from one language
Tongues in which we lose our diction
And celebrate the distinction of being one mass
I blaspheme because I don't know
Any other way to celebrate this
This one on one I have been having
With the spirit
Making me feel safe to call
Myself HIM; HER; THEM; YOU
As I deliver this speech
Embedded in a skill filled
With the fluency of my impulses
Saying no to this
Hate
Filling this speech
Meant for this crowd
That crowd
That rally
That congregation
That cyberspace, A poetic deliverance is
What I seek to give
Not the words from my mouth
But the
Words coming from within., Muchemwa E.R.S July 2012"
"Elsa Mugeta was born on the 15th of April in 1990 in a city called Debre Birhan, Ethiopia. Elsa started writing poetry to help better navigate through and adapt to a new environment when she had to study at Gondar University.For Elsa poetry is a shadow of emotion, with poetry she can better reflect her joys as well as her sorrows. ",Ethiopia,"This poem is set in a court of law, and the trial is between God and an unidentified creature of sorts, the jury is comprised of other creatures. It seems God is accusing the creature of wrongdoing and the jury without investigating the evidence deems the creature of wrongdoing, echoing the sentiments of God. This poem is commentary on how certain institutions and individuals have appointed themselves as Gods, with limitless power, and no one holds them accountable. The poet seems to be eluding to the fact that these misuse of power will continue if the rest of society is fearful to point fingers and hold these people accountable, fearful to present a just verdict to the court of law. She urges people to stop echoing what authorities say without questioning the legitimacy."

Beating in one rhythm, searching words like FAT music
So this is for fat girls
Who hold the sun entwined in their arms
Carrying purpose names in their curves
Laughing hard when the wind sings our fears
They are beauty conceived of madness
Sunset shakes, mouth full, bodies living through lessons
The winter of their summer outshades their comfort
They can hear themselves, beyond the touch of their toes
These full sized girls, who allow the moon to blaze their feet
.òTill the yellow blanket clothe their waists, This is for fat girls who play philosophers' stones
To build temples in our minds
To write life with one hand
To walk sideways with idiocy,
Fat babies who perch on mountaintops
Reciting ancient chronicles
Cover girls sell the dream
Of being complete, complete, completely nice
They named you fat to own your pride
And lied
So that you can die
To break your stride
And called you not good enough."

Mine is one, huge and clear
Earth pulling down
Mind pushing uphill
A war with Newton's laws, My blue backpack a burden
Cold biting nails
Feet dragging up, up.¶pole pole*
Until my bottom rests upon
The white-headed peak
Trembling
I shake God's mighty hand, From the top of Africa
I will come back full-handed
My blue backpack a blessing
Black Moses returned
A dream become real, Lest I forget
I will dig my soil deep
I will speak my father's tongue
I will sit on a woven mat
I will gobble a yellow plate
Of banana plantain
Mixed with mountain beans
Tender onions in palm oil
A mound of my mother's food
Mount Kilimanjaro on my lap, *pole pole = slowly slowly"

Is a scream begging to fly from your mouth
But you wouldn't dare transform
A body so visceral
To become a fool in the face of an oppressor
Has your frustration leapt into scream, His revolution was all catch phrase and metaphor
And the compulsions violent
But ooooh sooo poetic, When it comes to Agency of women
When it comes to Agency of sexuality
Hate was laced into word
With SUCH grace
And dignity, Can't you see my lips tremble
Can't you hear my heart waver, Even after his screams
His sexuality was given its walls
Walls re-inforced with armed guards whose limbs never grew tired
Whose guns were always warm and oiled
Even after his screams
And
Even after her screams
Her sexuality was caged, Her man, well his worship was always alternative
Even while agency of woman was boxed
While woman performed duty
Gestures to carry weight
Gestures to dig soul into ground
Lift, carry, bend, sway
Wash away
Wash away
Wash away
While agency of women was boxed, First came white bodies
Then came men with muscle and bone
To oppress
To push down
Power identities
Is my voice now tiresome
A familiar charade
Of power and victim
A familiar charade
Re-iterated I find no condemnation of men
By re-iteration
But by re-iteration I only remind men
I know what love those arms can hold
I've felt what love those arms can hold, Can't you see my lips tremble
Can't you hear my heart waver, My voice does not condemn
My voice is no call to defence or allegiance to only my kind
My voice is a call for your ear
A gestured sound bent into body
To listen
And then to accept
My body is not out for lending, Her body she bent forward to brace weight of hostile home
While his revolutionary lips spoke for hers
liturgy pronounced for the worth of voice made absent, I know a home is not always a home
Yes, I grew up and then learnt this was so, He grew up and never told me
His body hurt
When he could not force it to conform
To prescribed identities
But I guessed
it must have
When his love for another boy turned into hate
For himself
he fell down too many times
And the taste of sweet foods turned bland on tough days
But his body eventually found love
And the relief of home, Can't you see my lips tremble
Can't you hear my heart waver, Her mind and body brace in darkness to find one another
Detached they can't
share the weight of work
But to carry so much
They must remain
Detached, Or together
In a desperate bid to guard the whole from pain
Her action
May be a murderous one
And don't dare ask what that may entail, Because there are no nets for a domestic held captive
And there are no nets for a boy lost in the woods
With no standing tree to tell him
Go on,
Love, love
Love in only the way you know how
Because another boy waits for your bright eyes
And he will spin dizzy under the stars until your eyes meet his
Or until his body dies cold
With love held captive in far off galaxies, Can't you see my lips tremble
Can't you hear my heart waver, Has your level of frustration reached the point of climax
Is a scream begging to fly from your mouth
But you wouldn't dare transform
A body so visceral
To become a fool in the face of an oppressor
Has your frustration leapt into scream"

Nilipungiwa mkono wa kheri kwaheri tuonane mpenzi
Nafsi mie hufa ganzi kila wakati nimdhukuru,huyo mpenzi mi humuenzi.
Zilikuwa ni siku za enzi,chache sana sekunde zikawa ni siku na miezi.
Uwanjani wa ndege akiniaga kila siku atanienzi,na vile yake roho kupenda mwingine haiwezi.
Safiri salama kifika nandikie barua,wasalimu wanafunzi na wakeya watakaokujua,
Nipigie unandikie afya nijue unapougua,ilikuwa no safari ya mwezini nisha tambua.
Simu nazo zikawa ni za kwa urembo wa mfuko,barua zikawa nadra zipo mara hazipo,
Na hali zikawa nip engine yu salama pale alipo.
Kipindi chake cha kusoma,nacho kikakita mizizi,kipindi chake cha safari nacho kikazidi
Majira,wingu la wahka nalo kanizidia kichwani,ulipo talii salama bado nakupenda mpenzi., Pengine ilikuwa ni hiyo safari ya mwezini,
Rubani wa ndege ya kurudi pengine kafariki,
Pengine unapoishi paradiso kwako haipo dhiki,
Mwanamme wa kizungu pengine kakuhabaria,
Pengine sayarini kisiri ukaamua kuabiria,ulipo,
Mpenzi mie bado nakufikiria,maana mi huchoka simulizi kukuhusu nahadithia.
Maana ndoto hunijia,mara ufukueni mahaba tumetulia,na mara dirishani maua
nikikutupia,na busu la hewani hunipa ukishayadakia.
Naomba siku nyingine tena we mrembo utanijia,isiwe ni ndotoni tu,ila mzima utanikumbatia., Gambusi nacheza ulipo cheza ukiweza,arusi mi naiwaza ukirudi tena tutaipanga,nakukosa nakukosa toka hiyo nchi ya kishenzi,uzuru ndoto zangu sijali zikiwa ni jinamizi.
Na masomo yako nayaombea mola yakalete tija,sisadifu ahadi ukivunja urudi tena ukiwa mja,namaliza sio wimbo ilikuwa tu ni imla, Translation, Journey to the moon., Some few minutes before the good night wish,
She waved her hand and wished me a fortune,
Goodbye we'll see each again my love,
My inner self paralyses every time I reminisce,, My love how much I treasured you.
It was those past days, very few seconds turned days and months.
At the airport seeing her off, biding me goodbye,
And how everyday she will treasure me and loving another, she will not, And I said to her .òtravel safely, on arrival write me a letter,
Say hi to your fellow students and the Kenyans at large who will recognize you.
Call, and write to me so I know when you are healthy and when you are not well,
And it was a journey to the moon I have come to learn., Her call phone added a beauty to her purse,
And the letters became scarce and sometimes none.
And the situations turned wishes and hopes that she's okay wherever she is.
Her time of travel eventually started defying time,, And her program of study started beating seasons.
And that cloud of doubt blurred my mind,
Tour safely, I still love you my love., Maybe it was that journey to the moon,
The pilot of the return plane passed away.
Maybe wherever you live is paradise, you never lament,, Maybe another man from that place won your heart.
Maybe you decided to secretly traverse to space.
Wherever you are my love, here I still think so much about you.
I'm tired, and worn out, about you I live to narrate.
Since these dreams sometimes come to me.
By the sea shore, we romance as we relax,
And at times, I throw flowers by your window,
And you blow that kiss after the grasp.
The beautiful one, I pray someday again you'll come back to me,
Not only in my dreams, but wholly you'll embrace me again., This harp I play, wherever you are dance if you can,
I contemplate a wedding we'll plan it together when you come back.
I miss you, and I think of you, get back from that stupid land.
Visit and tour in my dreams, I don't mind you as my nightmares.
And I pray to the infinite for your studies to bring back fortunes,
I'm not okay if you break the promise and come back with a heavy belly,
I finish this is not a  song, It's a narration I write."

fabricated strands connected to their skulls
now stories of the struggle appear dumb
thy are shut down
schizophrenic smiles while they toi-toi

all running scares because it is shared in presidential quarters

to fill their rotten stomachs
to nourish their rotten minds
to produce rotten sound

people with swagger boots
synthesised tunes with kasi rules

who wrote books to encourage being African

with his lack of education and polygamous exclamations
spreading seed instead of doing good deeds

",Zimbabwe,"I drank wine last night
a bottle of my sentient red wine last night
pen and paper .¶. unfinished sentences on the floor
opal stones and  ivory bones on the floor
realities and dreams on the floor
room lights dim, open door last night
deepness to the brims of my art last night
floating on sweet red wine.
On the floor I sat with legs open last night
he came into the room, saw me floating last night
he stared  at me and said
.úYour legs look like they once belonged to a whore, please close them. If you saw what I am seeing right now.. you would hate yourself.ù, I stared back at him.¶., My lips and mouth cracked
as if my devils had murdered all the sweet
slurred thoughts took away all my sweet
I would not gift any sweet tonight
NO! I replied YOU hate WHAT you are seeing
My character is not limited to the sweetest of my face
there is an artist here
there is a free spirit here
who constructs and deconstructs her life and you hate that , You see me and you see your own dreams
you dream of what I could be for you
you want the parts you like and you want to kill the rest, just kill the rest
you want to experience yourself
and that is not who I am
You cannot pattern me to fit your own desires
just as your male body is incapable of bearing fruit
it would be fruitless if you tried to wall my being
my 9 months cannot be compared to your 2mins
so take advice from your penis
and recline back to where you came from, Since the dawn of the first day
men and sadly women as well
have tried to contain the feminine
females have been tugged on the arms by families, religions, conventions and culture
because they refused to lay on their backs with obedient moans, I know the truth of your power woman
I know the truth of your nature
nature holds no favours
a king can be killed by an elephant or fucking coconut, I choose to move with nature
My cycle and the moon's are one, circular returns beginning and ending at the same point in time.
out of my mouth I pour songs of love that would fill peace until the brims of your heart.
my hands, will caress ever fabric of your skin, so that every hair on your being shall know my fingerprints
for I am the cord from which you came from
I am the serpent wrapped around that tree
Athena, the Greek Goddess of war
would abandon her spear to taste me
for while men fight wars on fields
women fight wars everywhere
and I would rather die than fight a war within myself, There is none more dangerous than the intelligent woman
she lives on the edges of morality and grace
crafting reality out of fantasies
making this judgemental world her home
each time a book is placed into a woman's hands
men create distractions in the fear that they will have to go back to the nature they came from
so they say woman
you need to be as beautiful as that woman
you should not take up to much space woman
you should be quieter for you are a woman
put your book on your head, learn to walk nicely, focus on the mirror, please me
else you are unworthy in the eyes of men
else I'll make you a whore in the mouths of men
My sexuality is my own and my worth is not dependant on how many men have an opinion of it."

my daughter led me across the road
to a neighbour whom I did not know
with the purpose of a toddler
who does not see gates and fences
but the ducks and puppies
on the other side, You spoke to me in the same low murmuring tones
you used for lame horses and bilious dogs.
Crops, flowers and poultry were our theme:
you made me tea and wiped the counter,
you said .úFoeitog.ù and .úI don't hope so..ù
You guessed.
You told me I was beautiful,
in the courtly way of an old man., One day when it rained
you phoned from your side and said
.úI'm sending some ducks for Beatrix.ù
.ì you always called her .úBeatrix.ù .ì
out the window we saw them,
waddling over,
in the way of ducks
when directed by Oom Piet., You moved and I moved, but one thing stays:
the sense of a rescue, somehow being saved., Repair, Two friends of mine, hardly blood brothers,
have this in common: that they lost their mothers
to heaven or a better man at the tender age of four .ì
the same age as Beatrice when they met us.
Like all my friends they brought her treats,
teased her sweetly or applauded her feats
so that I thought, how good .ì they are healed .ì
they are here with us grown ups on the other side.
Until I noticed how when Beatrice cried
the great racking sobs of a child who is tired,
or defeated, or strung out like straining wire,
these friends followed when I carried her to bed,
stayed for the story, the caressing of the head,
waited for the bottle, the curtains drawn across
on a room full of children and their irreparable loss., To the doctor who treated the raped baby and who felt such despair, I just wanted to say on behalf of us all
that on the night in question
there was a light on in the  hall
for a nervous little sleeper
and when the bleeding baby was admitted to your care
faraway a Karoo shepherd crooned a ramkietjie lullaby in the veld
and while you staunched
there was space on a mother-warmed sheet
for a night walker
and when you administered an infant-sized opiate
there were luxuriant dark nipples
for fist-clenching babes
and when you called for more blood
a bleary-eyed uncle got up to make a feed
and while you stitched
there was another chapter of a favourite story
and while you cleaned
a grandpa's thin legs walked up and down for a colicky crier
and when finally you stood exhausted at the end of her cot
and asked, .úWhere is God?.ù,
a father sat watch.
And for the rest of us, we all slept in trust
that you would do what you did,
that you could do what you did.

It is about sharing the bread we break together
It is about sharing the bible we read as we gather together
Brother, mother, father, sister
Grandmother, grandfather together, Leadership is the ability to open up your ears
To welcome those whispering winds
Even across the driest of valleys
Killing the temptation of favour
Suppressing the urge to go beyond limits, Leadership is not about using violence as a tool
To keep the elite few in top rule
Shunning majority rule
And treating the majority as one fool
Leadership, Leadership is the ability to say I am sorry
I made a mistake
That was my fault
I promise not to do it again
Not throwing temper tantrums
When things go wrong, Leadership is not about people's urge
But the urge of their ideas
It is about using the force of logic
Not the logic of force
Leadership"

"G√©rard Rudolf was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in the year Verwoerd was assassinated. He spent most of his childhood in Cape Town. When he was a boy, he was convinced the world had been monochrome before he was born.îall the photographs in the family albums, the old movies on TV, all of it black and white. He spent hours trying to figure out how and when the world changed to colour. He roamed the neighborhood with friends creating strange worlds in empty lots.îCowboys and Indians, Star Wars, Huck Finn. School bored him. He mostly stared out the windows. His head was never where his body was. It still isn't. His teenage years were spent in Johannesburg. After school, he joined the military for 2 years because it was compulsory and because his family wasn't rich enough to send him into exile in order to dodge the dictates of the Apartheid regime. At 18 he did a tour of duty in the Angolan War. After his discharge he resolved never to wear a uniform or take up arms again. (so far, so good) He studied acting, moved to Cape Town and became a successful actor. He loved the collaborative nature of acting, all the oddballs and geniuses, and that no two days were the same.  In 1998 he co-founded a professional acting school in Cape Town because he wanted to give something back to the industry that had saved him from the 9-5. By 2002 he was utterly burnt out. His life was burning down around his ears. He felt as if he were sitting in a deck chair with a cold beer watching everything go up in smoke. He quit acting, got divorced, and moved to the UK where he started writing full-time as a means to orient himself on the map. He moved back to Johannesburg in 2010. He is not as dark and moody as people think. He blames this misconception on his face.

The woman in the flat upstairs is in her bath.
She is wrestling with a crocodile.
She intended the crocodile to be her lover
But he has turned into her predator.
I can hear the bathwater running and her thrashing about
In the bath, it could be the heat of ecstasy with her lover, the crocodile
But actually it is a fight for her life.
The thrashing of water and muscles becomes more audible
As I listen intently.
I do not bother to stir or raise the alarm.
I can hear her cry out like she is having an orgasm
But in fact the crocodile has grabbed her throat in his teeth
And is holding her underwater to drown her;
That's what crocodiles do.
Once she is drowned and silent and motionless
He commences to eat her
But leaves half her body behind."

So, I smoke the scalpel of memory, instead,

Of freedom
Sing songs of old
Of the fathers' dream
Dream to liberate
The dream song some day to come
Will be song of total emancipation
Song of liberation
Song of hope
Hope we anticipate
But long stayed in the dark
It is a folk song
Sung to the children of Africa
Opening their eyes to the follies of the world
Not to repeat the blunders of history
What they heard is no story
That we danced to tunes
That bears no similarities to our croons
Still we danced to loose
And on us they pounce
But we arise from the slumber
Creating marks on the muddy floor as we lumber
Reaching for the dreams of Nkrumah, Lumumba and Kenyatta
Dead and gone
But today for their bravery we beat the gong
From Monrovia to Soweto to Lesotho to Maputo
But they walked incognito
Not showing us that they were the black angels
Leading the way to total emancipation
Now, this generation
Shall harmoniously
Sing the song of total liberation
Song of freedom
Song of justice
Song of peace"

These days, the language of death
is a dialect of betrayals; the bodies
broken, placid as saints, hobble
along the tiled corridors, from room
to room. Below the dormitories
is a white squat bungalow, a chapel
from which the handclaps and choruses
rise and reach us like the scent
of a more innocent time.
I am trying to listen to the plump
Palestinian man with his swaying
rural middle-class patois, this jovial
servant, his eyes watering at the memory
of the eleven year old girl brought
to die inside these white walls,
her small body fading, her eyes
fierce with light and hungry
for wide open spaces, for decades
of discovery ahead of her.
When she came her mind was still
unable to calculate the treachery
of rape, to grasp how a man
could seek revenge on her tender body;
why as he wept when they took him
away, she wept, too, like the day
she wept when they took her mother's
empty body away, the disease
leaving her with nothing but bones,
thin skin, the scent of chickens.
I seek refuge in distractions:
the chapel of charms down the hill;
the pure sound of my youth,
when, cleansed by the perpetual blood,
my sins were never legion enough
for despair; when the comfort
of the Holy Spirit was green as this
sloping escarpment, thick with trees,
cool against the soft sunlight.
The plump man brushes
the gleam of tears from his cheeks.
I think of the simple equations
of compassion; I think of songs,
the harmonica, the strained
harmonies, the bodies of the dying
shuffling past, eyes still hoping;
the van waiting in the shade
to take me from all this;
the long ride through rain and dark

",Tanzania,"My wide hips dance
to melodious tones
of my tight thighs.
I am a soprano
of unique creation., My lips sing
a song of praise
about a mouth
whose thick flesh
I naturally possess., My chest comforts
young and old
as they weep hard
on soft wellness
of my big twos., I possess not
the imposed numbers
86-61-86
but look a lot sexier
in my natural curves., Oh!
Look at you
feeling all upset
about my pride.
Try be yourself."

",Botswana,"It's been hard, lately, the writing. Entire nights
spent alone as though loose change
Tossed inside a stranger's cup. A part of you dies unable to wake
Up and welcome the dawn as the play thing
You once loved as a child but if the sun ever shone, I don't remember it: the days I've held my heart in my fist;
                        Both young and old enough to know time;
No longer strapped to my wrists slips through the fingers like sand.
                   When the hours breathe, the minutes, the go
Unnoticed and grey as a drift of silver coy-fish gargled in the navel void
                          of a cold water pond at night, Drowning the voice of my own songs; my face sink; absence is also sound
                 Crackling in the insides of my skull
like a drug addict strapped to a straitjacket with no pills nor drop of water
                  left in a cold cup to touch the cracked lips
 of a hunger pain's ache far from full."

He is the organiser of Woman Scream, a worldwide movement to fight violence against women through art and poetry.",Tanzania,"A sip of white wine,
Made her nights endless,
Her heart replied, three letter words YES,
The moon gave her shades,
For her lips to collide,
And caused an overwhelming accident., Her eyes are always sober,
As if she was a drunkard,
Her eyes resemble a beggar's request,
I can't resist I'm tempted,
Over her I'll change ants to elephants,
Over her I'll turn her bed a singing choir,
Through that her sleep on my chest,
Wouldn't reach to an end., Her nose exhales fragrance,
That turns me ignorant,
Her name is stamped all over me
Like an envelope heading overseas
My hair erects when her hands climb over my head,
The next I'll love is our daughter,
And there she goes the fixer."
"good little children are seen and not heard; so HUGGEES spent early performing years more focused on looking pretty and less on speaking up. with a background in folk dance and steelpan, there were many opportunities to glitter across various stages in north america. HUGGEES left a chorus of primary schoolmates in trinidad and tobago to perform with a family band throughout canada and then later spent a year with a touring performing arts company based in seattle. during that transient time HUGGEES soon looked to thoughts for companionship. after winning a few speech art competitions, a personal relationship with poetry began; organizing spoken word events and performing spoken word quickly followed. HUGGEES now cohosts on community radio in both spoken word and caribbean music programming.
this for HUGGEES is the return from a much needed break from the spotlight. while working with under-served families, HUGGEES uses art as a therapeutic recreation tool. the motivation to engage audiences once more, stems from the continual exposure to communal secrets and the commitment to be more open in order to continue needed conversations around healing. there is power in performance.
HUGGEES is determined to be a carton voice, playwright, dohl player and other artistic ventures as breath allows.",Canada,"I needed a reason for us not to move forward
Stagnation had become our voyageur through time
And in my na√Øve mind I thought
If we could just keep our slow movement
The seasons would keep passing us by as a couple
So thinking quickly on my feet
Laying on my back
I told him that it was still too new to me.
I confessed that the sass in my speech and the .òS' of my hips had been deceiving
At fifteen I did not know where to find the key to unbridle all of my sexual energies
To unlock this treasure chest of tricks needed to please a man
Nearly twice my age and thrice as hungry
.úIt was still too new to me?.ù
As he sat up I imagined images of stumbling toddlers and sour green mangoes swirling in his head as he processed the information
He knew then that he could no longer waste his days trying to reclaim his lost youth
I knew that it was because he found no joy trying to relate to the uncertainties and insecurities of mine
We both knew where this was going and from the very first time I accepted a ride home in his car I believe we always had
So moving at the pace I'd become so anxious for
He slowly changed his story from giving me his undying love to merely lending me his affections
And on my sixteenth birthday on my sixteenth birthday
After eleven months and four days of what I believed was holding his heart next to mine for safe keeping I was asked to return it
.úIt's still too new to you and I can't chance you breaking it.ù"

Natumia Kiswahili kuwasilisha
Natumia mashairi kuelimisha

Zao miezi mbili,hio ganji kulisha wadhii
Na bill za hospitali

Nawaita partners in looting

I use poetry to educate,
I don't mix it up like a cook with the absurdity of hyenas,
Thugs in engineers and journalists despising us without apologies,
It is us who suffer insiders are hyenas.

In offices they pretend to be busy but it is only scandals
Eating, stealing with the pen,
It is like poisoning us Angloleasing,

It is dangerous with lawyers and doctors,

You get an accident even when you don't own a car,
Ask yourself why there is a hunger
Poverty
When we have money to pay over two hundred MPs,
That money in two months can pay hospital bills and feed everyone,
Education is expensive we buy it
No expansion of universities
Locking out poor students
While their kids get parallel education
and in good schools and universities.
They are crying to us they have nothing,
We send them to parliament like messengers
and when they are there;
Honorable horrible members
they start development of looting our coffers
mercilessly in fact more scandals,
increasingly as we remain noiseless and we don't ask
Why,
We don't ask as if our tummies are full.
Who will prosecute them?
They overcome us and we are the majority,

In the beginning was the word and the word was made man
See even God took actions on the words in her plan
Can you understand when our words were our bond
Now rappers spit words like their mouths are magic wands
Conned from words worth, tell me what's your words worth
When your words never ever into action even give birth
Words be like Oh No, now I'm meaningless
Before these empty MCs, you see I had meaning yes
The meaninglessness of words has now escalated
Self-hatred paraded on poster poles are under-rated
Sacred was the word when we thought before we spoke
It's a joke when freestyle MCs freely on their words choke
Poke it with a stick, words meanings sticking to the page
At this stage we've forgotten how to use our words to rage
Uncage the words meaning, let your words manifest
Lest saying isn't doing, so on your words do your best, Babblers babble 'bout blowing up as an MC
But cant see the industries still run by mental Slavery
Artists are an apostrophe, owned they're their property
Promptly, promoting commodities a priority
See these slaves endorse products aplenty
Where MCs get 10% while industry gets 90
Empty MCs on Empty TV's
Words are empty thanks to the corporate squeeze
Please .ì I never thought that I'd see the day
Where your flow is more important than acting on what you say
Hey! big word spitters, who do you actually rhyme for
So hardcore that the masses of listeners you ignore
I'm sure MCs an acronym for mental captivity
No sustainability cause everyone gets in for free
Put them on your guest list, you guest yes pockets empty
Empty like the beers they consume after entry"
"Haji Gora Haji is a poet, a writer and a minstrel whose art remained largely unknown to a wider Swahili public until the publication of his brief anthology Kimbunga (The Hurricane) in 1994. For forty years he has been active in a broad spectrum of Swalili literature. He is a word artist in the true Swahili tradition.",Tanzania,"Kimbunga mji wa Siyu,   kilichowahi kufika
Si kwa Yule, wala huyu,                 ilikuwa patashika
Kimeing'owa mibuyu,    minazi kunusurika
Nyoyo zilifadhaika., Yalizuka majabali,             yakabirukabiruka
Zikadidimia meli,              ngarawa zikaokoka
Kimbungwa hicho kikali, mavumbi hayakuruka

Nyoyo zikafadhaika., Translation:
A hurricane once arrived,
In this town of Siyu
Not only for this person nor for that,
It was chaos
It uprooted the baobabs,
But left the palm trees
The hearts were troubled., Rocks flew,
They rolled over and over
Big ships sank,
Outriggers were saved
With this violent hurrican
No dust flew
The hearts were troubled., The mansions,
Were blown away that day
They went far away				Arriving where they arrived
But the huts of the poor,
Were left in peace
The hearts were troubled., The frog dried the river,
The water stopped
The shore became fire,
The waves were alight
With half a bag of kapok
The cart was broken
The hearts were troubled., There is an ancient woman,
She captures the humans
She performs miracles,
She changed into different colours
Those who coax her,
Will perish
The hears were troubled."
"Hale Tsehlana is the Faculty Advisor for the Stellenbosch University Poetry Society, which she assisted to establish. She is a published poet and has read and performed her poetry in and around South Africa, India, Germany, UK and South Korea. Her collection titled Poems and Songs from the Mirea was relaunched in August 2007 at a special celebration for the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions hosted by the South Africa National Library for the Blind in Grahamstown and it has been published in Braille and Audio. In the face of current debates on multiculturalism and multilingualism in South Africa, this book takes a multimedia and multilingual approach to poetry with English, Afrikaans and Sesotho poems. The book encourages local writers to reach out to marginalized communities who may not be able to read and write; hence it is made into Braille.She recently translated a children's book Phapo's Gift that will be suitable for use in primary schools. She is featured in Ink@ boilingpoint, a collection of poems and essays by women from the Southern tip of Africa, (2004) 2nd edition. Voices from the Free State (2004), an anthology of Prose, Verse & Creative Articles by Indigenous Women and Youth of the Free State Province, and Basadzi Voices, an anthology of poetic writing by young black South African Women, published in 2006 by University of KwaZulu-Natal Press. Hale Tsehlana was selected to attend the November 2007 Asia Africa Literature Festival in Jeonju South Korea and in May 2008 she represented South Africa as one of the 20 young writers selected world wide to participate in the Seoul Young Writers Festival.

it is a song of hope, it is a song about tomorrow.
It fills the empty heart with fond memories,
It holds away the falling skies,
it wakes the little girl inside me., *Mankokosane, pula e ea nare tla hola neng?
There is no English translation for `Mankokosane, but some informal sources say it is the name of a rain god. The song also describes the kind of dance Basotho children would do at the beginning of light showers of rain. They skip, hop and sing that: .òthe rain is falling and ask when they will grow up'.
**Ha tsatsi le chaba .ì when the sun comes up.
This suggests that the children see themselves as little crops that are being watered by the rains and will have become taller when rain the stops falling."

Last night I died in Casablanca
And found my heart in Malawi
I watched the stars in Madagascar
And sailed across the Galilee., I walked the fields in Mozambique
And climbed the hills of Tennessee
I caught the sun in Buenos Aires
And chased the moon in Sicily., I met the Rose of Spanish Harlem
We danced all night in Tripoli
She followed me across the ocean
And we made love from dawn till three., I was reborn in Abu Dhabi
I found my soul in Waikiki
Tonight I'll sleep in Costa Rica
And live a life that's winterfree., Misdirected Woo
It was a dark and lonely tale
of misdirected woo
when they discovered quid pro quo
are difficult words to chew.
And when all is said and done
at the end of this sordid story,
it was apparent that all involved
were bound for purgatory.
To accelerate the inevitable,
they were executed two by two
and thus we end this lonely tale
of misdirected woo., Chocolate Economics
some people swear white chocolate is the best,
more pure and better, they say;
but with so many delicious varieties, how can one truly tell?
There's the Swiss chocolate, I guess it's grown in the Alps
or the German chocolate from right across the border.
What about the British chocolate
or the rare chocolate from China;
how different are they from Hershey's
or chocolate from the Motherland?
Is there chocolate in Spain, fancy or plain;
from the Congo or Nome, how about Bahia or Rome?
And we can't forget chocolate covered cherries
which must grow on vines in heaven,
on the corner of Dark Street and Rich Avenue
right next to Chocolate Mousse Gardens.
This is just a chocolate planet, from north to south,
east and all through the west;
I think I'll tour the Earth's chocolate islands
and find out myself which is best;
I'll keep a little for my personal use
and sell you chocolate junkies the rest."

Conscious mysteries so
Throw in your ears as my virtual poet draws
On the opportunity to feed you
These intrigue melodies go on as if
Agony poundeth my greased ears
Of peasants living in this lifetime
Pleading
Yelling
Begging for dear life and comfort
And you contemplate those soft seeds
Aligned to the mountains of food for the
Nourishment of thy bodies?
Just when you've painted out a clear image
to lie to your eyes
I utter these simple rather shocking phrases
These peasants beg for life in poetry
Poetry's comfort .ì
my, your haven
As sewage passages roam thy mind
You're falling calling me
And then goes the call to remind
Inadequate to die young as late as possible
But you blindfold me; you blindfold me
Un-blindfold me
So I can see the truth behind
Air based melodies that drift with my consciousness
And paths of righteousness
To poetry in motion
Your aural destination lies within books
Eternity is this thing I grew out of
when my own moralities pushed and pulled
towards those imprinted initiatives
Must be those overheated breezes
warming my mind as I come to realize
That I've been too loyal to reality
and now it's just time to let it burn
Burn
Burn into ashes that cover my wrong turns
Those mis-checks me and my soul created
when poetry grew into soul food
But I am ruthless
I turn blind to books that try to teach me how to write this, So this is this is
This is the beginning of these
Conscious mysteries so
Throw in your ears as my virtual poet draws

Lying slumbering in the sheet of heat
Smoothed gently across the Little Karoo.
No wind. Only warmth, but it doesn't press.
It floats, tenderly draping the spines and ribs
Into which history has folded these ranges.
Raging hormones of the earth's adolescence
Blasted entire continents into the sky
Leaving the remnants to drift down and lie
Locked into peace, immobile, their flanks
Not even twitching in the drowsy summer
Afternoons. Now they breathe in time with
The slowly passing centuries of geology's clock,
The beat too deep to resonate in our bones.
But the mountains hear it in their sleep:
Tick, and then the pause: aeons later, tock"

Brand new on the day you rose
To those gold streets we all long to see!

In this poem, the poet speaks directly to his home city Yaound√©. He speaks to it with anger, love, regret, longing and melancholy. The poem is an intimate message to a city that once symbolised hope and happiness to him and his fellow countrymen.  But now Yound√© is a shadow of its former self, it has become a place of little love, hope, pride and values.  , The contrast between the melancholic love and longing and the anger and despair of the poet towards Yaound√© is very vivid and real in this poem. He says, .úI flew with thousand wings, to be cradled in your arms, find in your bosom, the inexhaustible courage of my forefathers.ù but also laments, .úyou have bought and sold off the conscious of my forefathers. I come to beg you to free me, to free my people..ù"

The poet tells us about an incident where he saw a young girl walk into what was a potentially dangerous forest. He doesn't know whether to protect the girl or risk being suspected if something did happen to her. The poem  highlights the sad reality of  how crimes against children have affected relations between  them and people who should be their protectors."
"Hugh is a Baby Boomer Brat. He was born in 1946 on Nelson Mandela's 28th birthday (Hugh's closest brush with fame) at Tavistock in Devon, England. Rondebosch Boys' High attempted to educate Hugh without much success. Later, Essex University endured similar disappointments, but got over them.He has (had) three wives, and three children. Each marriage was happy in its own way and in its own time. The children are more beautiful than he expected. Hugh has had a job as a small, and sometimes negative, contributor to the technological revolution. He also produced bug-free code, but very rarely.Despite being commonly left-brained, and occasionally no-brained, Hugh writes poetry that is sometimes published. He attends the Off-the-Wall poetry gig Mondays in Obz, and hosts monthly gigs in Kalk Bay and Kommetjie. He edits New Contrast. And, aside from a natural tribal arrogance, he is kind and tolerant, even of dogs.",South Africa,"She awaits the black,

"I love life; life loves me because it has blessed me with a gift: Poetry, my doorway to the secrets of the Universe. I never claim to express undeniable truth but my own, one I wish to share with the world. Words have power, my mission is to use these words to paint the life I wish to live as well as the world I wish to live in .¶ and poetry is my paint brush! My vision is simple, through the words I express I want to bring change! Thank you for joining me on this journey!",Ethiopia,"As I was sitting with a pen between my fingers &amp; racing thoughts
As I was getting ready to write down this world's many plots
It occurred to me that some lived free from disturbance
When others don't even come close to such an abundance
In places where calm, quiet &amp; tranquility
Can only rhyme with futility, rarity &amp; vitality
Where freedom from violence is only so Extreme
That even the thought of it makes it seem a Dream
Where Bombs going off at everyday's ' 9 Oclocks
Have become like the explosion of Disneylands Fireworks
Lands where negotiations aren't made to sell sheep or cattle
But there is no other option coz they must stop the battle
And from where I sit a dispute never involved a gun
 Worst case scenario you'd throw a rock and run
But they're talking about negotiated peace through signatures of treaties
As if we didn't have a piece of peace inside, it's an insult to all types of deities
Some have bottled up anger in their lust for power &amp; created its release
And they're the same ones meeting to talk about restoring the peace
Ironic though, as if it could be stored and locked up somewhere
 It is being thieved, stolen and robbed from everywhere
But a portion of it still lies within each of our hearts
So don't tell me we want to fold our arms &amp; not do our parts
That none of us want to tear war apart and piece peace together?
 Because we owe it to the ones laying in pieces &amp; scattered all over
Serenity now! If you've got ears that listen here is a piece of my mind
They say no peace for the weary but tell me who doesn't deserve a piece of mind, I am sure you have your whole thoughts &amp; you might want to share a piece
But do so now or forever hold your peace !"

the strike of the hammer.
Funny funny funny is the laughter of wisdom,
cuz the people perish for lack of knowledge., The final power shift will come to the source,
once powerful &amp; bound by unity.
Broken away when the treasures were stolen.
Africa unites before this manifests., Modern day wars with bombs as weapons,
aint no need to shoot when the trigger is explosion.
Kill 'em all, and not one at a time.
Cuz time is of the essence and speed is pride.
Power of the richest .ì .òdo what thou wilt' .ì
Same feather birds don't only flock together,
they challenge one another &amp; try to match strength.
Friends they were but enemies they will be,
when they hunger &amp; thirst for the same one thing.
A fight will occur &amp; they will both lose,
affecting everyone so the world will have to end., There's always a God.
He's the one who's the builder
cuz when the ashes come, the dust must be swept.
Orbit in motion, he sets the ball rolling., The power is the cell, energy in the sperm.
Blood is always thick, fuel of the life."

And raise my voice in praise
Of the women of my country
Who have worked throughout their lives
Not for themselves, but for the very life of all Africans
Who would I sing my praises to?
I could quote all the names
Yes, but where do I begin?!
Maybe, maybe, I would choose a name
Just one special name that spells out light
That of Mama Nokukhanya Luthuli
Maybe if I were to call out her name
From the top of the hill
While the moon is shining bright;
No-ku-kha-nya!
NO-KU-KHA-NYA!
Maybe my voice would be carried by the wind
To reach all the other women
Whose names are often not mentioned
The ones who sell oranges and potatoes
So their children can eat and learn
The ones who scrub floors and polish executive desktops
In towering office blocks
While the city sleeps
The ones who work in overcrowded hospitals
Savings lives, cleaning bullet wounds and delivering new babies
And the ones who have given up
Their places of comfort and the protection of their skin colour
Marian Sparg, Sheena Duncan,
Barbara Hogan, Jenny Schreiner.
And what of the women who are stranded in the homelands
With a baby in the belly and a baby on the back
While their men are sweating in the bowels of the earth?
May the lives of all these women
Be celebrated and made to shine
When I cry out Mama Nokukhanya's name
NO-KU-KHA-NYA!!
And we who are young, salute our mothers
Who have given us
The heritage of their Queendom!!!"

Feel exhilarated
Pulsate with devilish desire
As you forcibly sowed your shameless seed

That you mutilated
The ground that will now
Forever remain infertile
Because of you?, I want to know
If you sleep at night
What kind of dreams you dream?
What kind of man strangles
Fondles a two year old
Was he born of a mother
Like my own who bleeds
Tears every time she sees me
Begging to be forgiven
For not having been there
To protect me from my own father?, Somebody tell me
What kind of a world this is
That sodomises its future
Telling the young ones
Not to believe in love
Not to dream
Not to dare
No to dance
Not to laugh
Not to treasure life
and believe in humanity?, Tell me somebody
Because I must believe in something
I must believe in things kind
And gentle
I must believe that the sun
Not only shines
For those who stand before it shines
But for those like me too
Whose limbs were severed
Before they even learnt to crawl
I must believe
The world can be better than this!, 6 November 2010

"Isabella Motadinyane was born in 1963 in Mofolo Central, Soweto. She went as far as Grade Five in her formal schooling. She studied piano at the so-called .úFive Roses Bowl.ù and attended dance and acting classes in Jozi. As a result of creative writing workshops she wrote the poem One leg in which contains the phrase die is mos botsotsos. This phrase afterwards gave rise to the name of the Botsotso Jesters, the poetry performance group of which she was a founding member in 1994, and whose publishing arm, Botsotso Publishing brought out the two collections, We Jive Like This (1996) and Dirty Washing (1999), from whom the poems in this collected works are taken.She was brought up by her grandmother and adopted the surname Motadinyane even though, when she traced her roots and the whereabouts of her absent father, she discovered that he was from the Mabalane family of Meadowlands and Ndofaya. At the time of her death on 19 February 2003 .ì her fortieth birthday .ì she was living with her mother in Orange Farm.As a stage presence she was unique .ì confident, varied, vivacious. Her rich voice both sang and spoke, infusing her poems with great musicality; as significant, they worked equally convincingly on the page. Her voice is captured on the Botsotso Jesters cd, Purple Light Mirror in the Mud (2001). Indeed, Isabella Motadinyane used Isicamtho and Sotho to create a powerful legacy of performance, poetry and song. A collection of her poems (as previously published with the Botsotso Jesters) entitled Bella was published in 2007.",South Africa,"Nonhlanla is gone

I first love the sound of the guitar
It first makes me dream out loud
Come
Come on my flower
Let's take a ride out in the desert
We will howl out at the moon
Walk with me my dearest flower
I am afraid to travel alone
Sit with me and watch the sun rise
As we listen to nature's song
May I hold you beloved butterfly
And warm you with my love
Love skyward toward heaven
Take sight of the flying doves
Come rest your soul beside me
Find comfort in the shelter that is here
Seek love and you will find me my love, Come, come, have no fear
Pink flowers grow widely in the garden
I'll spread their petals on our bed
No need for you to lift one finger
Just rest your pretty head
And if we go away
I promise you joy
Without pains that plague .î-
Let the future on the life before us
Say goodbyes leaving the past behind
When the sun rises my angel, shall be with you
Never allowing your face to
To stray from me
In my arms is where you belong
This we know to be true
The doves we watch
Cannot compare with the beauty of you
And the fear I once felt
Has long left my mind
You have given me strength I could not find.
Laying you down in a bed of rose petals
God, what a beautiful sight
Lovely enough
To grace the halls of heaven
On any given night
Butterflies and nature's secrets
Can witness how our love has grown."

and broken promises, open hands that push back as soon as receive., And they tell me you are better now,
and I'm not buying it, how it was once the Blacks , and now the Eastern Europeans, dear city
of seemingly open doors and closed signs turning , in neatly shuttered windows; dear city of borders
and invisible divides, of grime and drum and bass,, all harsh, metallic music and brick-wall vowels,
and everyone so willing to pull the ladder up behind them., This was supposed to be a love letter
but it's hard to love a place that could never take, my true name in it's mouth, a place I was born
but always wondered whether I truly belonged., A Psychogeography
A few straight days and no unbroken cloud. Above: a one note sonata, an airy drone. All the better to forget what went before, like all the other landmarks erased from your map of immutable things. The corner shop that's no longer there. The pub on the corner swapped out for a new-build apartment block. The block of flats on the horizon and all its concrete mass, now empty space. Once, and only days ago, the air was filled with light and heat.î an electricity that survived in the dark with a hum like a bell remembering the impact of a heavy hammer after the fact. Do you know the anatomy of a typical bell? Crown, head, shoulder, waist, lip, mouth and tongue. Today, the air has fallen silent. How quickly the mind adjusts to what is."
"Jacques Coetzee tutored English literature at the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch for several years before becoming a full-time poet and musician. In 2003, he obtained an M.A. Degree in Creative Writing from the University of Cape Town with a collection of poems entitled Singing Through. His English translation of Eugene N.

Together with poet Barbara Fairhead he is currently involved in a musical project, Red Earth &amp; Rust, which released its first album of original songs, Look For Me, in 2008.Lyrical poet and musician, Jacques Coetzees poems are born out of the need to surprise himself now and then. In his words: .úWriting them is like taking a walk without knowing where it will lead.ù. His evocative and sensory poetry comes from a desire to bring attention to the place where the inner experience and the world meet.",South Africa,"Beautiful beyond words, these clear blue notes,
These wild blue notes that hang in the air
Like a cathedral floating in the sky
Beyond the body's reach.
Hey, music men, how did you make them,
These notes so pure and wild?
Listen, and I will tell you:
With your own bodies, muscle, blood and bone,
With your chests swelled out and your feet planted firm
And the song like a tree rising up between them., It's flesh and blood holds up this edifice,
Straining against the pull of gravity."

"Jamaica is without doubt the foremost nation in the world for reggae! However the cultural, political and social climate tends to shape the musical offerings of this glorious nation.Kokumo is a citizen and artisan from Jamaica whose debut album Writing's On The Wall may well be the finest recording in the dub poetry vain for many a decade. Kokumo's delivery will obviously draw comparisons to Mutabaruka but there is an originality of style that will appeal to audiences worldwide.Described as not just an artist but also a cultural anthropologist and dub-griot, Kokumo uses his skills as a singer/songwriter and a dub-poet to capture his audience, whilst taking them on a cultural, spiritual and political journey.Hailed from the parish better known as the cockpit country in rural Jamaica, seems to have contributed to the powerful voice that allows his words to take flight.With a name meaning, .úthis one will not die.ù in Yoruba, is synonymous with the notion that his work will be around forever.His work is rooted in the consciousness of Rasta and the cultural experiences of black people worldwide. This consciousness was triggered from an early age which he credited to being around his Rastafarian cousins but didn't manifest until a later stage in life when he began to write songs and poetry.Kokumo's multidisciplinary skills as a performer have landed him roles in plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company and his own sold out production, GENESIS 9:25 @ The Birmingham Rep. Theatre, 2010. He also appeared at The Tate Britain, The Poetry Caf√© London, BBC Radio 4, B-Spoken Word, BBC WM, Robert Beckford Show and the colourful face introducing Benjamin Zephaniah at Griotology held at The Drum, for his T.V. documentary, This OBE Is Not For Me.Kokumo has being commissioned to write and perform for organizations such as Oxfam International Birmingham, Arts Council England, West Midlands and BBC WM to mark the 200th Anniversary of the abolition of the Slave Trade in The British Parliament.

And here I am!
I found out that my given name
Has no significant meaning
Other than a brand and a means of false identification

We studied anatomy; we had the first physicians
We were the first
To do open heart surgeries and brain operations

I an' I believe in the teachings
Of Marcus Mosiah Garvey and his prophesies
And the positive words of Robert Nesta Marley (Bob)
I found out that all the negative elements about us
Were injected during slavery and is now affecting our society
Racial and social segregation
Is affecting the behavior of the younger generation
And it's simply a state of confusion
That is leading to their destruction

And declare myself an Afrikan
And furthermore a Rasta man
It's time for repatriation

"James Matthews, poet, writer and publisher, has produced five books of poetry, a collection of short stories, a novel and an anthology of poetry, which he edited. Most of his work was banned under the previous government and was translated and published overseas. For 13 years he was denied a passport and was placed in detention from September to December 1976. Solitary confinement was widely used during the apartheid years; its purpose being to disorient, to dehumanize, to undermine the detainee's sense of self-identity. James Matthews waged a struggle against this agenda with the one weapon the jailers couldn't take away from him .ì his ability to turn words into poems.In 1980 Matthews participated in the Frankfurt Book Fair, and in 1982 he participated in the Cultural and Resistance Conference in Gaborone. He was awarded a Fellowship at Iowa University, U.S.A. and was the founding member of the Vakalisa Art Association and founding member and Patron of the Congress of South African Writers. James Matthews is the first black person to have established an art gallery (Gallery Afrique) in South Africa, and is the first black to have established a publishing house (BLAC Publishing House 1974 -1991) The publishing house closed in 1991 due to constant harassment by the previous government. Matthews is the recipient of the Woza Afrika Award (1978), Kwaza Honours List .ì Black Arts Celebration, Chicago, U.S.A.(1979) and the Freeman of Lehrte and Nienburg, Germany (1982).

you were to me,
something like a book.
And so, I could never really see you,

the stable words,
that always were, and weren't you.
Fathomable, unfathomable.
At best I read you casually,
as one sees maps,
Or highway posts,
instinctive, distinct,
flashing past in the dark.
Or by chance,
and predictably,
Where the spine was most worn thin.
And who in the world,
could have known,
when closed,
what strange language,
those words made,
folded over and over.
And perhaps, it is another's place
to mourn you,
Who gave you up to the world instead.
I'm sorry, I don't go back,
That, I stack away,
Distort, forget,
I have stories I like to tell of you,
I have a story I like the best."

And dances the .útwisty.ù
Round and up, round and down
Side to side, side to side., Pieces of rubbish strewn by the roads side
Cannot resist the dance
As they fly higher and higher
In the gust of wind., The trees groan and creak in crescendo
As they try the .úpaka chini.ù dance., The clouds rapidly gather
Followed closely by it notorious siblings., At the signal of the invisible conductor
Lightning shows itself off
With flashes in the sky
Like the blinking lights on the Christmas tree., A prelude to the mighty drummer., Like a classical music piece
The soft murmur of the drums
Rumbles to a crescendo
And climaxes to a thunderous roar!, Then drip and tap, drip and tap
Then the larger drips and faster painful taps!
And finally the heavenly  flood gates are opened
And the pounding rain joins in the chorus., The parched earth opens up, To greedily soak in the music
From nature's harmonious orchestra., The invisible conductor gives the final command

He has been publicly speaking since the age of seven when he started reciting poems and rhymes for kindergarten events.Jason became really interested in poetry after moving to the US, and as time went by, he slowly developed a love for performance poetry or as most people call it, spoken word poetry. In 2012, alongside some of his close Cameroonian friends, he co-founded LEGACY ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS, which is a collective of African artist whose main focus is to elevate and expose the beauty and the brilliance of the African Art.Jason Nkwain's poems focus on the continent of Africa and especially its people. Looking at the African people through the eyes of an anthropologist, Jason seeks to expose the beauty in Africa's story. Jason seeks to dispel most myths and to shatter the false His-Stories, creating room for the truth in Our-Stories.Some of his well-known poems are Thoughts, and Have You Ever Seen An African Dance.Jason Nkwain is currently a senior at The University of Maryland College Park double majoring in Geographical Information Systems and English. He hopes to become an English professor some day focusing on African studies.Website: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Legacy237"">https://www.facebook.com/Legacy237",Cameroon,"They say we dance like rivers, hands flowing North like Nile
Like deserts do not surround us.
They say we move too dynamic to be in disarray
Too potent to be powerless,
Too spirited to be mummies,
Too vibrant to be starving,
That seasons do not pass when drought tucks us into bed at night and famine like roosters crows emptiness into our mornings
They ask
How could dried up xylophones ring out such rich symphonies
And why is there so much life in that barren planet of a person , How does a man answer such questions, how does he breath truth into the ignorant, so I answer with this simple question , Have you ever seen an African dance?
 Have you ever felt the music possess limb to limb
Like there are Angels having a feast in body
Spiritual movements paralyzing each vertebra from remote to rural , Have you ever seen an African dance?
Have you ever sat in awe and watched the rhythm take flight in mind like rockets
Full orchestra playing and matching in sync
Forgetting that this man knows not piano
Knows not of viola's complementing violins
Cello's and double basses
Nor does he know of woodwinds and brass
Or music sheets, all he knows is rhythm,
How he composes symphonies with each movement
That raw, untainted and unmastered rhythm.
That causes his feet to pound firm on the ground
Crusty and cracked enough to build trenches yet he stomps
Forgetting that the soil can taste his blood
Does it taste like fear, like he knows that his barren soil will not produce for his family?
Does it taste like negligence, like he willfully ignores his plight like incompetence is his mantra?
Does it taste like cowardice, like he cringes at the site of blood, of tears, and of death?
Does it taste like death, does it taste like a plague, does it taste like a curse
Does it taste plain and empty, like there's a zombie residing in his inner residence?, Have you ever seen an African Woman dance?
Have you ever watched her hips steal the spotlight gyrating in fervent excitement with each drumbeat?
Smile synonymous to sun like she did not cry rivers last night
Like the man who was meant for protection did not become a predator and her prey
Like his flesh did not become Prime, and hers pillage for his desires
Watch her hips gyrate in pleasure like they did not gyrate in pain last night
Like the beautiful earth around her waist did not crack, and quake like Armageddon
Like she did not pay for her beauty with mundane beatings.
Have you ever looked into the eyes of death and told her that there is something lively about her
Watch her hips gyrate in joy like they did not quiver at the sight of her son six feet under
Watch her hips gyrate with so much freedom like she did not know slavery too well , Have you ever seen an African King cry?
Watch his tears dance down his cheeks in morbid helplessness
Galloping through the bed farm wrinkles on his face
As he watches his people dance on empty stomachs
He looks and notices that
See through Vessels never looked so beautiful
The way the sun finds home in melanin
Skin never hugged bones with such force
Vicious plagues never plagued a place with such potency
Would you want to know his thoughts?
Would you want to know the silence that dances inside
Would you want to know the nervous inferiority that causes his head and feet to nod and tap?
Would you want to know that his throne carries no power?
Because a seat is not a seat when faith is lacking
Would you want to know that he is king only by title because circumstance has stripped him to peasantry?, Have you ever seen and African dance
Have you ever looked on in tears, heart skipping with smile and said, .úthis is beautiful.ù
That this grace is worth glancing at twice
When rain meets a sunny day
How his outro fades like the sun behind the mountains at dusk
How his movements are tears filled praises
Limbs telling folktales worthy of the king's ears
To say that this dance brings our souls before God
How our knees kiss the floor in humility and our hands marry the sky in adoration,
and how our hearts pour out its supplication
That in this state of devotion, we find faith, we find flaw, yet a blazing firefly still buzzes within
That we move like there's a solar flare skipping inside
That we dance because it frees the soul from this shackled flesh
We dance like its our last for our legacies are more genuine when painted on tainted canvas for tomorrow may crumple this page with dementia causing us to forget the heavenly joy that was penned here tonight
To rest in our sleep and wake up anew moving like pain did not sleep here tonight
So the next time you see and AFRICAN dance, pause, take a moment, look closely, and maybe just maybe you might find the joy hiding in the crevices of our plight."

"Javier Perez is a poet, performer, and teacher. Born in the U.S., his family immigrated from El Salvador during a violent civil war. Growing as a .úLatino.ù in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in America, Javier always came face-to-face with questions surrounding identity, masculinity, class, and heritage.As a first generation university student, he studied political science, while quickly developing a passion for spoken-word poetry on the side. With some friends, he started Swarthmore College's first spoken-word collective, OASIS (Our Art Spoken In Soul), and competed at local and national poetry slam competitions. After graduating, he was awarded the Thomas J Watson Fellowship to travel internationally for a year in pursuit of an independent project: an exploration of how poetry can empower, heal, and give voice to criminalized youths in light of the massive growth of prison systems worldwide. After traveling to South Africa, Australia, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Brazil, Javier concluded two main things: crime and incarceration are global phenomena intimately linked to histories of colonialism, racial violence, and inequality; and poetry provides a transformative space for communities to challenge, reimagine, and change the status quo. He now lives and works in Cape Town as a resident poet for Usiko Trust, facilitating poetry workshops alongside youths from the townships to create a space for exploring their voices and (re)writing their narratives. Javier is very keen to foster stronger connections and dialogue between communities in Latin America and Africa that share common roots, histories, and struggles.",United States,"Dear Fausto
Your lungs hung like a fragile manifesto
	From the rusted chain of a hypnotist's watch
Your lungs hung out like homemade punching bags
Or stubborn fruit, too aged to nourish the child
	Waiting by the old trunk of your young bones
	Under the branches of your cigarettes
I ask you now
Did you finally inhale deep enough
	To expand those lungs into hotair balloons
		To get you as high as your broken wings failed to take you
Or did you pop, through overinflation
	As your friends made too many blows to your elastic soul
Dependence can forge chains out of your bones
	Tie tightropes from your sinews
And turn your spine into a one-way escalator
		That carries Hades up to corrupt the design of your heaven
I pray you now rest in peace
I know you instead rest in pieces
	Like shattered flesh of a scarecrow
		Scattered, by the same exhaled breath that gave you your last high
			Or rather your last goodbye
What god forgot to massage the rubble of your heart into a temple
	Before it became its own burial ground
When your liver became ol' graffiti'd walls
What hunger drew the map to the ruins of Eden
	To be ruined by forbidden fruits of the sweetest .òmasculinity'
Did you get high only to reverse the Fall of Man occurring within you?, It takes a village to raise a child
So it took a village to keep one down
When the world failed to raise you
Of course you had to get high on your own
To get away from the demons piercing the soils to grip your ankles like shackles
	Until the earth itself convinced you:
		You are made of demon
But fear, my friend, is often mutual
And one man's heaven is more easily built
	If he creates enough demons to populate a hell
Yet I wonder if I too failed you
Did I misread you long enough
for the hieroglyphs of your pain to become engravings on your tombstone
When I decided you'd never change
	I didn't just give up on you
	I gave up on myself
So I apologize, on behalf of this Kingdom of god that denied you
For having plucked your feathers
	And still expect you to get .òhigh' enough
		To fly like the angel you always were."

In the fields,
To whom do I belong?

To myriad burning lights,

Yet all are subservient
To the lone, lunar monarch
In our ever so skewed perspective.
Am I but one of them,
Fixed perpetually
In a brilliant jeweled blanket?
Not more beautiful?
Not more bright and burning?

Of an ever grander multiversity
Of talents unique and outstanding.

Often overlooked.

Not its last.
And my life is short lived;
Transient at best.

Myself, I do not see.
Though the world be full of steps,
I do not see where now I stand.
What am I? Where am I?
When am I?
And who is .úI.ù?
A mistake.

Even has a place: I am without.
Out classed and out numbered
And beaten by the rest.

past the lighthouse, past the rocks,

THE BLUES
Sometimes you forget all about them in spite of yourself, but all too often the very first thing you realize when you wake up is that they are there again.
Not that they are actually ever seen. They are always said to be blue, as ghosts are always said to be somewhat grey.
They do not appear and disappear.
They are there because they have already come.
They only shift from the foreground to the background.
When Jimmy Rushing sings; .úGood morning Blues. How do you do.ù? Blues say
.úI feel alright but I come to worry you.ù.
Trouble and struggle, is it all worth it?
That's the blues.
That's all blues.
No wonder Hamlet came to debate himself to be or not to be.
After all, that's the question when you wake up with the blues
there again.
Not just all around your bed but also inside your head, as if trying to make you wish that you were dead.
Or had never been born.
The Blues.
BUDDHA HAD THE BLUES
Buddha had the Blues.
Just listen to the four noble truths.
All life is sorrowful
The cause of suffering is ignorant craving.
The suppression of suffering can be achieved.
The way, is the noble eightfold path
You see?
Told you.
CHANGEABLENESS
The fact that people
put up walls
in front of us
or take them down.
Is not a attribute of
our perception of sight.
The tranquil and eternal mind
does not discriminate
in shapes or forms,
but has brightness of its own,
and imageless.

my eyes look north,
my eyes look east.

from the composite sketches of my broken eye.
Singing a new song, amening crazy crazy crazy crazy lullabies.

That's how I happened to hear what she said to a man who came near
To offer his condolences.
She said .úI want you to understand and please know this;
Yes!
I've second guessed
God and at times asked him why.
And yes!
Alone in the dark
I oft times cry
But when my eyes are blessed to greet a new day
I understand that I have to live at least two days, today.
And I understand in someway
This is all in God's plan
So I've laid my burdens down
And taken up God's hand.
Because when the chemo goes long
And I'm not so sure that I can go on
God gives me a shoulder I can lean and rely on.
And when I don't want no more Ensure
And I'm not so sure that I can endure any more
And I fall to the floor
Not wanting to die but not truly understanding what I'm living for;
Not understanding who I am
Not understanding what am I to do
That's when God takes me in his arms and he carries me through.
And yes people love comparing me to
The strong and the brave
From Ali to M.L.K.
But what I do is not brave
Because I, just like they
Do what I have to do.
Step in my Dr. Scholl's
And you'll see that neither my shoes nor my soul
Have walked an easy road
But I remember being told,
.úIt's the path you choose
But the path that chose you..ù
The same quandary faced Luke, Mark, John and Matthew.
So I laugh at those who view this as a tragedy
It seems sad you see
But I used to live the life of Sadducees
So don't be sad for me
This had to be.
Sometimes the buildings destroyed in catastrophes
Were simply blocking some things you had to see.
And right now let me
Clear up some of the fallacies associated with my malady.
Though the chemo leaves me weak
My soul is so complete
That even when I cannot speak
You can see, feel and hear me through my smile.
And when this earthly host is gone
And my ghost is carried home
I'll live on through a poem
And be reborn as a child floating down the Nile.
Though I may have cancer
cancer will never have me!
Bald with one breast
I am more and no less
Than any woman you will ever see.
I am Yesterday,
I am tomorrow
I am Now and forever me.
I've never asked you to pity or revel me.
I've never asked you for your pardon or revelry.
My mind is more concerned
With the current turns taken in society.
You know just the other week I saw The Passion of Christ
On a movie screen.
I saw his pain depicted in some very moving scenes;
But if I can't find the passion of Christ
In everyday human beings
Then three hundred mil in tickets sales, what does it all mean?
Understand that these infants,
These seeds that we've sown will grow
Into little visions of we.
My trials and tribulations
Have shown it's so much bigger than me.
I'm trying to see these acorns grown into bigger and better trees.
And I'd give the other breast
If I thought that it'd help you to see and believe..ù
And on that note she turned to me
She gave a smile, she took her leave
And she
Was oh so Beautiful."
"Julian Curry started writing poetry in 1999. Besides receiving the 2003 crown at the Nuyorican, he was also the 2003 Bowery Poetry Club Co-Grand Slam Champion. His poetry is a glimpse into the inner city, Wall Street, family, and a regular guy's everyday life.Originally from the Bahamas, Julian now calls Harlem his home. He has been featured in Forbes Magazine & on BET's Lyric Cafe. He was also featured on HBO's Def Poetry Jam.",United States,"Whassup my niggaz, I said whassup my niggaz?, That was a trick question.
And its nice to see that the tricky ones haven't tricked most of you all into the answer
you see nigger's been passed through our families, generation to generation like a cancer.
It used to be said by slave masters who weren't in the business of breeding no dancing Niggers
they only wanted good old field Niggers.
But I wonder how the field Nigger would feel
if he was seated next to you on the A train at approximately 3 O' clock any day of the week
and he heard his little great great grandson speak dozens if not hundreds of times from 59th street to West forth
The word that made black families pack up in the South and move North.
Would he slam a couple of these boys against the doors and ask, what's the deal Nigger? Do you think you keeping it real Nigger?
Do you know how I was killed Nigger? They murdered me, with hot rods of steel Nigger.
Now how do you think this makes me feel Nigger.
Or would he just sit there and listen
silently like white people do
silently like I do
silently like we all do. So what do I do?
I go down to Wall Street.
Do you know why they call it Wall Street?
Because centuries ago there were these huge high walls and down on the street slaves with shackles on their feet
were there to be bought and sold by the fleet.
Like shares of intel
phrases shouted daily like
where's my niggers?
There's my niggers. Whose niggers are those?
Now here we are centuries after slavery
insulting our Ancestors bravery by shouting phrases daily like.
Where's my Nigger? Wodap Nigger, you know you my Nigger right?
So don't blame the boys on the A-Train.
Blame who put the myth it was ok to say it in their brain.
Blame the kings of comedy, the all time Nigger record holders.
Put the blame on Quentin Tarantino's shoulders. And hopefully this Nigger, Nigga, Nigga poem is making you uncomfortable.
To the point where you're cracking your neck and staring down at the ground.
Looking to your left and your right, staring at the few white people around.
Helping you realize that you've been bamboozled if you think you have to wear blackface to be a clown.
But I gotta go now, I gotta go now, I gotta go now.
I gotta get this poem in the hands of the artist formerly known as Prince now
because when it comes to talent, ain't nobody's bigger.
And maybe this poem can be the gun and his voice could be the trigger.
We could collaborate and figure a way to convince Jigga
to help us write a new dream song or a new theme song and call it
the people formerly known as Niggers."
"Jumi who holds qualifications in Dental Surgery and Medical Informatics is the Creative Enthusiast behind IMOLE, Jumi's Spoken Cabaret is an innovative compilation of ten inspirational tracks of ironic weaves of recitals, songs, poetry, word games, wit, metaphors and subtleties set to varying genres of music.Jumi sees poetry as a fascinating tool that gives expression to a passionate and unorthodox voice. She clearly feels very much a part of her audience and believes that in listening incisively they will find twists, turns and whimsies of our collective destiny food for inspired thought.A .úproudly Nigerian.ù poet, vocalist and lyricist with a tender tough stripe of cultural louche and spiritual commentary, Jumi's artistic style is bold and imaginative with a conversational voice that sounds almost reticent.In Jumi's Spoken Cabaret, she maximizes this compelling and inimitable style to ride hot currents for the pain and pleasure of swooping around spiritual, pure, social, maternal and fragile subjects. Whilst doing this, she clings to images of reality that are firmly embedded in what she perceives to be the public's consciousness, acknowledging issues people feel they are familiar with or can relate to, offering a speculative but entirely plausible view.Exposure to Yoruba griot sounds, classical forms of music plus a need for and hunger to express truth's tale becomes tension released in distinct ways in each of the ten tracks on the CD. From deep sentiments to an indigenous groove set to a lush vocal background to epics of gratitude carrying a sensual earthiness, the entire production is a consolidation of international and traditional styles fused into a deeply personal approach.Jumi is happily married to her friend Kola and has three daugthers.",Nigeria,"The things concealed belong to the Ancient Of Days
The ones revealed belong to us and to our children forever?
The idle man declares it his sole ambition to catch the lidless eyes of the crab blink
Just to clandestinely squander a lifetime at the river bank
The hypocritical wife of the blind bat, she compounds her husband's frustration
By buying him a magnificent hat huh..
Like she forgot he flies upside down!?, But this anthem speaks of regency, nobility, matchless royalty?
Even the white fowl is known for its innate sense of inherited superiority
(Too to o ye ki ediye funfun mo're l'agba ennn yooo)?
The blood crusted finger nails of the village kid?
Betray the unvanquished army of thirsty head lice?
Promenading beneath his profusely pomaded kinks?
(Ah bi'na o ba tan l'ori, eje ko Ie tan l'eekana!)
Why ceremoniously caress crisis that calls for the cross??
Why vials of virgin oil for hemorrhage needing virtue in the virgin's Seed?
And when in that anemic state we respond to Kabiyesi's call
To partake of martyrdom's sacrificial potion, Eje Erujeje
The veins of wild beasts, bulls, goats, heifers go into sudden spasm?
For we are imputed with His Son's righteousness?
Yet the great Emi Mimo must help us walk to the finish righteously?
The Rooster .ì crimson comb, weighty wattle -that once strode in the front yard
Is led down the aisle of boiling water, murdered to wed pounded yam for dinner
Roast regret, stewed skeptic, vexed with vegetables in a cursed calabash?
Who dares tell his descendants water has no foe??, You see, esu doesn't mind all the wandering about in a religious daze
So long as the corruption deep within remains shielded from the true light of day
Hell, my friend has no palaver with the man who may be kept enthralled by the dance of his own silhouette
For the one who has practiced the art of madness long enough
Bores bystanders when he finally succumbs to the lure of a street parade
Spells of sanity remind him that the Musungu, the Oyibo man warned him not to cry, .úWolf!.ù
Ah, but here's Isaiah's own command,
.úArise, he says, .úshine for your illumination is here!.ù?
For glory is risen upon the crippled old gazelle
Once content to roam in the company of sycophantic vultures
Healing, regaining swiftness, she is poised, like Simba to seize her inheritance
Her elevated gaze, dwarfing the lofty Idanre announces that it is as vast as the sea, The cloud of witnesses, the elders whisper that our true identity was formed in a distant past  and that we are summoned to imbibe  it by emerging from the shadows into invigorating radiance; by arising from the grass to be numbered in the sunbathed canopy of the evergreen Mangrove.¶
Hearken with unwaxed ears; look with salved eyes.îThe Revelation!?
Time fades into oblivion, life swallows up death!
Interminable dawn interrupts intermittent night!
The carcass, the corpse of darkness alone remains.î- (oku okunkun lo kuku ku!)?
With enlightened zeal, come strum your harp! Dominate the planet!
Fill it with mantra, ancient and modern, all composed in the presence of the Morning Stars
It is the culmination of all things, the hushing, the hushing of creation's wail,?The manifestation of the King's sons.
Eyin ara,?There is a place where the hot and cold springs of Ikogosi embrace?
It reminds me of the warmth of the secretplace where we may dwell with Atobiju
Under the shadow of Eledumare , Arinu r'ode, Olumoran okan?
Come, come ascend with a clean heart.¶
Enter, enter in with holy hands.¶come, come"

He believes it is designed to keep black people weak and meek, and people should continue sending their children through this system if they do not want them to be strong, independent, and powerful people. The poet says they are not taught about self-confidence, self-valuing, self-education (knowledge of self), health, nutrition, relationships, sex and sexuality. They are not taught how to question and to reason. Justin is advocating for a new education system, one that will instil a sense of pride, teach them about their true history, and redefine the brains of many brainwashed Africans. The education system needs to build a strong people."

The is that is
The eternal before eternity
The still before stillness
The one before unity
The source , The source became aware
In this awareness came a knowing
A knowing of prime limitless power potential
To experience the depths of this self awareness , Know they self
The original desire of first being
Unfathomable to infinitude of infants
Of whom I am potty training and puzzle playing
Finding more pieces that fit together
Revealing a games called
.úLife: The Divine Comedy.ù
The forever at play
The excitement of first being
Becoming all beings
All things formless to form
Clear skies to storms
A spiralling now through dimensional swarms
Torn fabrics of space/time
Time/space
Down from no time exploring physical traits
One to infinity as one
Knowing self through myriad divisions
Seeming limitations and forgetfulness , 7 steps till full remembrance
We drive bodies on the 3rd
Til the soul has balanced its cups
Full of thoughts, actions and words
Aligned in the natural urge to fully serve
Bring darkness into the light
Sight to humanity
Becoming the butterfly emerged , And the journey home truly begins"

Adorned with dark colors inside and out
And the agony they endure at the initial shock, until the pain gradually fades away.
The stress is felt at their head and center.îa dull and pulsating sensation that comes and goes, as if something is being stripped from the inside,
As if something is being squeezed from the inside.
And everything about me changes; all is affected by this death of life, of freedom,
Until comfort returns., Their sleep shall be restless tonight and for some nights to come,
Until the crying lessens and the tears begin to dry.
But the tears they cry are red, and they come from a single eye.
Yes, they bleed for those whom they mourn; they don't just cry; they weep.
This is no superficial mourning.
And pleasure shall be forsaken and denied
For enjoyment cannot be had while mourning,
And their state will be recognized by all
For the colors of mourning are black and red and dark blue,
Colors that can hide the tears if they decide to show.
But soon, the tears will flow clear and few.
And my legs, they will act with care and restraint, for this is no time to be normal.
They cannot be normal no matter how hard they try, or how much they pretend, or how deep they hide.
A force beyond them has gripped them.
Somberness has taken over., Sometimes they double up in pain, but that state is soon over.
And sometimes they cannot keep still out of fear of the unspeakable
Until the mourning period is done, and they can don their light colors.
Until the mourning period is over, and they can do what they used to do.
It has happened before    (not too long ago)
And it will happen again     (soon)
My legs are in mourning today, and almost all week."

"Kaizer Mabhilidi Nyatsumba was born at White River, in the province of Mpumalanga, in White River, South Africa. He is the son of the late Silverton Manikani Nyatsumba and Maria Ntombizodwa Nkambule.Kaizer went to a number of schools .ì Entokozweni Primary School at Ngodini (KaBokweni), Lwaleng Primary School outside White River, Ngodwana Primary School, Mshadza Secondary School outside White River and Dlangezwa High School in the Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal area .ì before proceeding first to the University of Zululand and later to Georgetown University in Washington DC, USA.He started writing plays, acting in them and directing them when he was still at Ngodwana Primary School, and continued to do the same at Mshadza Secondary School and at Dlangezwa High School. Some of his published poems were written when he was in Standard Seven (Grade Nine) at secondary school, and his first published newspaper article was in the now-defunct KaNgwane Times in Nelspruit when he was in the same grade.A born leader, Kaizer was appointed Deputy Head Prefect at Mshadza Secondary School, Deputy Head Prefect at Dlangezwa High School, Editor of UNICOM at the University of Zululand and Chairman of the University of Zululand chapter of the African Writers' Association, which he launched. Upon his return to South Africa upon completion of his studies at Georgetown University, he was elected Assistant Secretary of the African Writers' Association at national level.Kaizer worked for 15 years as a journalist, a profession in which he excelled and rose meteorically to become South Africa's first African Political Correspondent and first black Political Editor on a formerly white newspaper, The Star in Johannesburg, and the country's first African Editor when he was appointed founding Editor of The Independent on Saturday in Durban. He also edited the Daily News in that city, before being posted to London, with his family, where he was Associate Editor on The Independent.Kaizer was one of seven South African journalists sent by Independent Newspapers to the Harvard Business School and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University for an intensive, two-month-long Senior Leadership Develop Program in 1996. He is also the only journalist within the Independent Newspapers Group to have been seconded to The Independent in London, then the international flagship within the Irish-owned media group.
Kaizer left journalism at the end of 2002 and joined Anglo American South Africa in January 2003 as Vice President: Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for marketing. In that capacity, he persuaded Anglo American to back South Africa's bid for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and represented the company on the Board of the 2010 Bid Company. He travelled to a number of countries .ì where Anglo American also had a presence .ì with then 2010 Bid Company CEO Danny Jordaan to campaign for South Africa's bid to host the 2010 World Cup.With Jordaan and then First National Bank Marketing Director Derek Carstens, Kaizer visited Barcelona and Madrid .ì where they met Barcelona FC and Real Madrid FC players, including Ronaldinho .ì in an attempt to get either one of the Spanish giants to visit South Africa to play against the country's top teams, Kaizer Chiefs FC and Orlando Pirates FC, as part of the promotion of South Africa's candidature for the World Cup. They even travelled to Valencia to watch Real Madrid beat Valencia FC 1-0, thanks to Ronaldo's goal, and flew back to Madrid with the team in its plane.Regrettably, the two Spanish teams could not accommodate a visit to South Africa, thus opening the way for London-based Tottenham Hot Spur to play against Pirates in Durban and Chiefs in Cape Town.Kaizer has also worked for Coca-Cola South Africa as Public Affairs and Communications Director, Sasol Ltd as Group General Manager: Corporate Affairs, Marketing and Black Economic Empowerment, KMN Consulting as Managing Director and PetroSA as Vice-President: Corporate Affairs and Shared Services. He is currently Chief Executive Officer of the Johannesburg-based Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa.A Certified Director (IoDSA), Kaizer holds a BA Honours from Georgetown University, an MBA from the University of Hull, a Post-Graduate Certificate in Economics from the University of the Witwatersrand, an Advanced Management Programme Diploma from the University of Pretoria's Gordon Institute of Business Science and a Journalism Diploma from the Newspaper Institute of America.

His seventh book, Incomplete Without My Brother, Adonis, was published in July 2014",South Africa,"NOSTALGIA: I WANT TO WALK ON FREEDOM STREET
I long to walk on that dusty road
which turns and meanders
indifferently
past igloo-like mudhouses
past old makeshift fruit markets
past brazen street vendors
and past a pitiable lonely school
homeward
I long to walk proudly
on such a road
stopping on the way
to greet a friend
or to chat with a stranger
or even to land a hand
to an old man covered in dust
trying to find his way home
stopping on the way
to marvel at the beauty
 of such a desolate place
or to drop a cent
in a beggar's tin
or even to listen
to the cry of a hungry child
I am tired
of the entrapment of the city
whose glittering stands beckoning
to take me away
from the quiet and tranquillity  of home
to this city
this Washington that knows no night
the glare of lights
and the deafening noise overwhelm me
I want to go home
I long for my home
on freedom street
I long for the peace
and the quiet of the night
I long for its frighteningly
murky nights
where I will sleep sound
fearing none of civilization's
snares
I long for the place
where I grew up
a place where birds chirp
and doves coo on trees
under which children frolic
a place where man is still man
free from the fetters of civilization
.ì      that is my home., WORDS
on their own
they look like
sheep on a precipice:
meaningless
unimportant
and vulnerable
but shepherd them
cull them carefully
adorn and string them
together
and they will sing
words
are like our bodies:
denuded or attired in tatters
they prick
sharper than thorns
they pierce
like a scorned mistress's tongue
and shame
their utterer
but draped in fineries
they soothe festering wounds
revive broken hearts
smell sweeter than incense
and compliment
their source
so clothe them presentably
my brother

Casting the mystery of presidential elections
Crossing the political forest of leaders
Panting in agony of persistent hunger
Winking at desertification
Dancing to the orchestra of unity governments
Gesturing warlords their destruction
Wallowing the wings of despair
Passing through this intertwined economic recession
I am yearning for a forlorn of harmony bloom"

"Kate Ellis-Cole is an enigma. Always perfectly styled, she carries herself with a secret confidence that's almost regal. Grace and eloquence spill from her lips in conversation and it's difficult not to form certain preconceived expectations when this soft-spoken lady steps on stage: she's white, she's a woman and she clearly sounds privileged. And then she opens her mouth. Kate's poetry and subject matter is far from what the initial impression would lead one to expect. From political satire to the strong cross-cultural ties she experiences with land and country, her poetry reflects magnitudes of conscientious and sensitive living and there's something about her and the unapologetic sincerity with which she speaks and performs that's endearing and mesmerising.",South Africa,"Fuck perfection, Just give me a chance to love you, I know that feeling, .ì I want, you to know it too .ì, when the sun rises inside:, When the horizon is your shoulders, And your face is the sky, .ì The rays catch your eyelids and explode into stars., And just for a moment you know what you are., I know that feeling, When your voice is too tired to sing, And there's just nothing, (And everything) to do., Again, then, I want you., I want, To plant seeds in your face, In the space, Where things were taken away., Seeds that grow trees, So everyone sees, The joy that sprouts leaves on your forehead and cheeks., I want, To dig trenches down your cheeks where tears would be if you ever cried, For me., Or for you., Or for anything you wanted to., I want, to, disappear into you, The same way that fingers do, If you press hard enough against soft sand, With the flat palm of one hand., I want to bundle you, ( safely ), in my heart, And wrap you snugly in my skin, So that no one else can ever get in., I want you to take me to places you've been., I want to be terrified, And lost inside, The haunted house part of your heart;, see the parts that hurt the most,, And tell you I don't fear your ghosts"

",South Africa,"I stood between two grand cities as each of them whispered, .úRemember me.ù, Jozi was lean,
Her walk was packed with ambition
And her hairstyle was gelled in a cosmopolitan composition.
She wore a suave scent laced with aspiration
And tied her thick confidence around her waist with extra intention.
I had to catch up to Jozi.
Jozi's pencil-skirt matched her high-heels coloured in the pastel energy;
So with every kwai-kwai came a plan,
With every street corner, she moulded a wise man.
Jozi walked maboneng
I had to stand aback to catch my breath and adjust my eyesight to her light.¶
As I watched her stride,
I noticed how her rhythm was inspired by the bassline from Bree street taxi frenzies,
How di-kip-kip reminded her of childhood simplicities,
And how she kept bopping her head to Gandhi Square after-school cipher beats.
Jozi finally waited for me,
Smiled because she was the daughter of pirates and chiefs
and she still knew the perfect spots to feast on lightly-salted chicken feet.
For a moment in brief.¶
Jozi took off her branded shades and underneath I spotted her golden humility.
Jozi, the celebrity, reached to secretly touch Cape Town's arm, whispered .úremember me.ù and carried on walking., Cape Town said it in a light breeze,
His smooth baritone made my frantic heart freeze
As he reminded me to just.¶
breathe.¶
He maintained his cool pace by letting beach sands filter through his crooked toes,
And how he always captured a bottle of perfect merlot,
Not even he knows.
I tried to rush him to catch to Jozi,
but Cape Town just strolled.
He spoke slow.¶
Telling me how he frequently had lunch with visiting ladybugs on mountain tops,
how from up there it felt like the Atlantic sea warmed itself under his feet,
and how fresh air made life easier to eat.
Winds made his linen shirt rise from his fertile chest,
while winter rains made his bare feet wet
but, unphased, Cape Town carried on telling me how he appreciated a bobotie mess
and cried whenever he thought of Clanwilliams in living context.
Mr. Cape Town spoke of ironies like: beautiful bergies and short stories told about long streets.
His kaapse taal swept between his naked gums as he punctuated in Xhosa clicks.
He had time to tell me many things (and still write to Jozi)
but it's the peace that he fed me as we wondered through his Garden route that articulated: .úRemember me.ù, I stood between the two cities but this time I asked them to .úremember me.ù"

This, now I find, is my treasure: the source of envy for your enemies who are against you, because you are inscrutable and content. Never appeal to be less!  , This is our discovery, that the man of gratitude draws to himself more desire and interest than the man of possessions. The foolish defeated run to claim gratitude as their shelter; that they did not plan to have more victory! But the wise conqueror knows when to stop conquering, because he is grateful.  , To identify the point in life at which to be grateful is to identify one's genuineness to define his purpose. This is for those who believe that death is inconsequential, because their ideals are of the human spirit, which is in constant resurrection."

The woman planted a drum on the grass before her.
Twisted a soft worn khanga round her hips.
As if she was going to wash clothes, chop vegetables;
hike a child to her back to go to market.
None of us really paid any attention., The woman harnessed her hips to the drum.
Chest-high, foot-in-diameter msondo drum.
Rocked it aslant between her straddled legs.
Settled into position.
Sunken chest erect.
Shoulders, neck, at the ready.
Mouth set over gaping gums.
Khanga hiked up skinny strong legs.
Feet grounded in the earth
like it was time
to do business.
Like she was going
to work., Suddenly, we are on
Planet Kidude.
Where men scurry across the mat:
place mics, arrange wires, jostle for camera views.
Where the woman ignores them all.
Because she did this for eight decades,
before there were cameras, mics.
Decades she hoisted her drum,
trudged rich dirt
the length and breadth of Tanzania
to perform.
Decades she fought off
terror, insults, mockery
the soul-destroying silence
only the strongest fire survives.
Decades she travelled deep and deeper
to the heart of her own rhythm., This is Bi Kidude.
Virtuoso of Taraab, Unyago.
Woman who at ninety-five,
has walked more miles
than most of us have driven.
Claimed a lineage
of music rooted
in the lives of the powerless
stories unfurled in language of street and market
poetry buried in the bodies of women., II.
I have never seen a woman ride a drum before
like a goddess rides a tiger
like creation rides the cosmos.
I have never seen a woman ride a drum like this.
I have never seen an artist
male or female
anywhere across the globe
own their instrument like
it grew out of their belly,
like it was welded
to their thighs., III.
Then, there were the dancers., The dancers moved lazily.
Dropped their cellphones, shook out their khangas.
Gold at their ears, their necks, their wrists;
gold gleamed in their mouths., The dancers slipped into movement
as a bhajia slips into hot oil,
rises to the surface
starts to sizzle., Now the dancers work their hips
with a precision of balance, control
a potency of strength, of muscle isolation
Olympic gymnasts would envy., They shake their hips
for all of us
who have been taught, coerced
to disown our bodies. For all women
whose bodies
have been stolen from them., They thrust their succulent buttocks out,
with democratic largesse.
Tease the old woman in the black buibui.
Taunt the white-boy, dreadlocked tourist,
who feigns coolness
behind his wraparound sunglasses,
while I watch his neck turn scarlet, drip with sweat., The dancers work their hips
for the waitresses
at Africa House Hotel. Caged, in the most godawful
ugly, cheap, confining
sweat-producing black skirts, white shirts
to serve drinks to tourists in shorts and bikinis., Because heaven forbid those who serve
should ever feel breeze on their skins
heaven forbid those who serve
should move their hips and torsos
freely in clothes that flow
colours that hum.
We might forget they are servants.
We might
see them., The dancers shake their hips for the women, those waitresses serve. Waxy-pale
bikini-clad tourists,
at Serena's poolside.
Women who check their bodies daily
for criminal fat
outlawed abundance of flesh.
Women of the tragic sisterhood
of liposuction, surgical alteration
silent epidemic of anorexia deaths.
Women taught that beauty
equals self-annihilation., These dancers swivel their hips
for the six-thousand girl children who today
were held down, legs spread, hands tied,
gagged, blindfolded, tortured
beyond screaming, violated
beyond horror, circumcised
for the crime
of a clitoris., They move their hips for every woman
infected with HIV
by a man who valued her life
less than his gratification., These women who circle Bi Kidude
as planets orbit the sun,

they are shaking the bounty
of women's bodies
back into the world., Their hips and butts are saying: YESS!!
YES
to largeness that does not apologise.
YES
to power, knowledge,
that do not disguise themselves.
YES
to pleasure,
claimed and vested
in our mortal beautiful bodies., III.
I will never fear aging again
because now I have heard Bi Kidude
belt out
at ninety-five
without a mic
tobacco-stained waves of sound
sandpapered down to coconut fibre
stronger than cables of steel., I will never fear aging again
because now I have seen Bi Kidude .ì
whose face has never touched
an anti-wrinkle cream,
an age-defying glycolic acid enzyme peel,
who knocks back whisky, cigarettes
for every ounce of moisturizer I consume .ì
hypnotise a hundred cameras., I have felt the power of this woman's neck,
her shoulder muscles
surge thunder
down arm to hand to drum;
generate more electricity
than ten Madonnas
a hundred Fela Kutis with sixteen-piece bands
take us back to the center of fertile creation
where sound begins., IV.
I believe in Bi Kidude
the way I don't believe in god., But if god were a ninety-five-year old, ebony black
Swahili woman,
who claims to be one hundred and twenty,
with a mouth full of broken and missing teeth
hands veined like banyan trees
a drum between her legs
a kijiti at her defiant, all-knowing lips
a shillingi-mia-kumi note flapping out of her neckline;, if god chanted wickedly satirical shairi
about the dangers of the very deathstick
she sucks on;, if god embraced irony, lust, contradiction,
heartbreak, imperfection;
if god flaunted her struggles like a velvet cape,
rearranged the atoms of the world
with the rhythm of her gut, then maybe I would believe
in that god.
That god who is only a name
for the genius in all of us
that makes us our own imam and prophet
our own divinity., I would call the faithful to prayer:
Bomba Kidude! Kidude Saafi!, And they would holler back: Saafi!
They would holler back: Saafi!
They would holler back: SAAFI!, And we would all be, god."

That butter-milk fit of emotion
Frothing and beautifully rising.¶
Culminating in a sense of euphoria
Or the black pepper anger
Poured in maximum quantities
Dulling our senses, Are we our bones?
The structure that holds us together
Helps us stand and not crumble
The skeleton of flesh
Curved out with ingenuity
From the day of inception, Are we our senses?
The five that we know
See, smell, touch, feel, hear
On which we rely for perception and direction, Are we our blood?
The oxygen-filled red that flows in our veins
Giving our hearts substance for beating
Regulating our breath, Are we our possessions?
The thinks that give a sense of security
Cars, houses, money
The pretty, the flashy and dashing items, Intricate beings
Floating in shallow waters
Not swimming in the deep
Not standing with mountains, Is flesh gives birth to flesh
Shouldn't spirit give birth to spirit?, We are not our skin
Neither it's tone not texture, We are not out lips
Not its words, nor movement, Our very substance is more than we think we know
Our truest nature is beyond this surface."

How am I to be now that I am made of glass
And my words have no sound except for those uttered in a past
Sometimes I'm black when politics parodies truth and quantity is king, sometimes I am black
Sometimes only in the vaguest sense do I have history, a memory, a cultural reality
Easier to keep me in the dark, easier to talk about the Indian ocean slave trade as if it were one of the stepsisters
Easier to say that I almost suffered, am almost one thing not quite another
Somewhere between here and there between 1994 and the present I was lost on the periphery of a South African story because if memory serves the historical themes it seems my people were never participants in the resistance
Never marched , never fought, never died
Coloured anomaly, forcibly removed, survivors of slave ancestry
The sum total of my past coined thus and by degree I'm the not so bad off progeny
We won't omit you completely, we'll just play with the lighting so it won't look so frightening
Pieces of a story just enough said so you'll go quietly to bed

filling the gap between yesterday with a smell not unlike that of the underdog

but history it seems is a commodity something dressed for a particular emphasis sold to the appropriate buyer
.úbut it's not that simple.ù they tell me, .ú there are complexities if you please, don't over simplify!.ù
is it complex to lie, makeover, storyboard, edit so you don't see the ones slipping through the cracks till suffering has one colour and prosperity another and I become the pain you see through now that I am made of glass
and the skeleton of my ancestors can be seen in the faces of the young
we carve a dubious future at best
but I like a ghost will not rest until equal means what it is and recognition is fair and suffering has not colour
till I have no more gooseflesh in these modern day prisons of freedom for all where we create more underdogs for the next struggle

",South Africa,"(to khalo, who is preserving his brain), Which one is going to survive?, When you ever get there
Tell us, Of the uptight spring diligent delegation, Sent to ask god to advance new, Gourds of understanding. They asked for another five
						hundred thousand
Centuries to douse the flaming towers of memories,
							they even
Offered to batter their fingers, along with gold studded
								staffs
That were pecking the sulk on the ground their children
Had hidden
A drawing as a scroll to god, Of bloated stomachs
Skeleton skulls
Glued beneath a pattern of cringed dry leaves
Of indigenous trees, they called the painting winning., The letter the children sent to god said:, .ò'Ask us why
There is loneliness in people
And we will count
The sands of the Sahara
Who is going to survive?, Dambudzo died
And the ghosts that painted hearses
Over Great
Zimbabwe look to me were the same ghosts that
						tormented troy,
same ghosts that got stuck in the throat of carthage., I saw a flick in my dream dambudzo got kicked in a park
                                                                                                      in Harare
Behind a bar that has a trail of piss framing its spine, I got the chill spell of sobukwe and hani's gazing ghosts, I got the person with the stature of Cyril who is going to
								survive, Another 500 centuries another delegation bearing hand
							made crafts
And gifts for god, and their children knew it yet, When the wind blows
Don't let it blow your mind
When oldest of the elders howls
A regally grey impish howl, Then you know the road wedges into a point
At the far end
For us all, after another five hundred centuries to go
When we stop digging
in the chambers of our noses
Mining a sense of existence above all
The circumferences that always bring us to this, Tell me
Who is going to survive?"
Kibrom Habtu is a poet based in Mekelle Ethiopia.,Ethiopia,"Midnight Walks, In the darkest hours
of those murky nights
beyond cold limits
in the thirst waves
of longing thoughts, At pensive fiery hours
of empty landings sight
there is a black shadow
under the harmony voice
of hungry restless dead, The tranquility shadowy
aspiring in my heart hath
led away to endless dark
avenue bled midnight walks, O sad Moon erase darkness
my soul preserves outshines
in my dreams I see myself
in the range of my belonging
faith bubbles soothing hell, Souls beseeching forgiveness,
pleading for mercy, I mottling
pale yet stood motionless forth,
and forth I resolution walked,, My emptiness hunting death depart
the stillness of empty land still
stretches and moonlit grows,
view to my soul darkened heavens
light form dimensions skips across., If these yearning avenues
bind those numb souls
directionless Monstrosities.¶, Years of my reminiscences
brightened this moment agonies;
if darkness remain and conceal
lost thoughts of my memories;, And if I lapsed dreaming
again death parting my soul
beyond longing cold days hope
forever more saunter must I athwart, Erstwhile midnight ago
the vanishing hours
of my presence enlightened
my shadow cast souls, How tenderly I live on earth
I wilting how decently I crave
future, how adherence lingers, within me as if I am
to die I was expiring., Still for the last time,
for only once, death
and I may sink together
in my moon cast dreams., In the journey
through those avenues
of midnight walks."

I know a man,
From his snowiest peak
To his grit and his sand,
Through his feet planted deep
In the sweetest dark earth,
Where his legs rise like tree trunks
Entwined at his girth, His arms are the waves
Of a strong ocean tide,
And his chest is a mountain
Bursting with pride,
His jaw hard as rock
Keeps emotion away,
While his lips soft as grass
Are where my kisses play, His eyes are the cave pools
Deep underground,
And his breath in the wind
Turns the seasons around,
His hands paint the night,
And a million white stars
Trace his kiss as he leaves
To watch me from Mars"

I thought your chicken pox scars were bullet wounds

You were an ex child soldier who had fought for their lives into my arms
You became precious for it
My blood diamond, I counted the number of times they shot you baby, you survived 27 shards of life
You carry bullets as baggage, You ran, You ran
And smashed otherly into my embrace and were loved, instantly and ignorantly
I became drunk off your spit
Your breath became my Talmud
Your eyes my new testament
I obeyed your sighs and gasps
My coarse hands and ignorant fingers discovering you, The truth in my honesty has been whole
At times you freeze my breathing and allow me just enough oxygen for thought, My hands happened upon the small of your back
I unclipped your bra as though it were unlocking your ribcage, We made love
We made love, like shifting sanddunes
My goosebumps fucking your pores
Our tongues trading taste buds
Our temples trading worshipers
Our thoughts trading gods
Our bodies trading inertia, I woke up with your water sitting in the gutters of my fingerprints
You rained on me
You weren't even the perfect person
My imagination could never have engendered such a person
This ex child soldier
Who doesn't even wear socks, Lately I've been learning to write simultaneously ambidextrously
And that is to say with both hands at the same time on exceeding lines to
Gently
Break through the exoskeleton your heart has developed like osmosis
And
Like Meiosis
Gently break your heart in two, Lately I see raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles with warm woollen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with string
But these are not my favourite things, I can make the rain fall in iambic pentameter
I can make aliens stop and listen to my prose
I can make Ages miss their curfews
But you
Lately I can't even get a second glance from, So let me write simultaneously ambidextrously
And that is to say at the same time on exceeding lines to
Gently
Break through the exoskeleton your heart has developed like osmosis
And
Like Meiosis
Gently break your heart in two, So you might

To be drunk by my master
Ready to be poured into his cup
And break my alabaster, Dark skin
Smooth as within
Delicate and vulnerable
I knew he would treat my heart
The way he treated my body
The way he treated his tea
The way he liked it, Hot and spicy
Sweet and tasty, He never waited for it to cool down
Never waited for me to be ready, Never thought that the hot chai
Could burn his tongue
Never realized that I was too young, To be drunk
By a man old enough to be
My father
To be exposed
To a mouth that treats my hot tea
With a cold heart, He touched me
And I cried
Sizzling my heat on his tongue, I cried
Tears of pain
Were mistaken for pleasure, I cried
For I was that Chai
That I made
For an unworthy tongue, I cried
As he extracted from my tree
Every leaf that
Would give him more tea, I cried
For the fact that he didn't care
That he defiled me, I cried
That there was no one
No one
Who could help me
The ones that I depended on
Had left me, They hid in their own caves
Engulfed by their own fears, Cause we were only slaves
Slaves to our masters desire
I was, he said, the special kind
For his special desires
His concubine
His suria      , I cried
For the years I had spent
Keeping myself
For my husband, I cried
For my parents and my little siblings

My youth, Gone
My love, Gone, All because this man
Wanted a taste

A quest for way out still a work in progress with a dead end
In the midst of darkness the lights have gone off you can't find the switch
When the future looks so bleak you are about to freak
Need to get outside but the door is locked you can't find the key
On an endless chase and the target has become a wild goose
Even the odds are stacked against you and the pundits predict you will lose
But hey! Don't despair, hang in there keep your focus on
The Bigger Picture: The Bottom Line , Your road to success will be a ground swell of the shadows of doubt
Paved with banana peels, filled with stumbling blocks and thorns
The fat lady will be making noise declaring your end before you even start
Then there will be the side storms: you have to stay strong
School your skin to become thick for a flesh wound let alone a spiritual one
Turn a deaf ear to those barks from the sides; they are worse than the bites
Your will has the power to cast the light on those shadows of doubt
Stay blind to those tempting sights; put your blinkers on and keep your focus on
The Bigger Picture: The Bottom Line, An injured flesh, injured soul, injured being
A memento of how the bygone days have blemished your back
Put your wits in zigzags like a drunkard after a couple of six packs
Yours is a life filled with regrets, a lesson learnt the hardest way
Plenty of time you spend ruing a dropped catch imagining the kind of life you would have had
Look ahead, don't look back, forward is the only way; not reverse
Life is a journey and the globe is your means to traverse
So sit back relax and enjoy the world as it leaps in a verse towards
The Bigger Picture: The Bottom Line"

that getting to the top really amounted to something.
That if he had a goal, he would ultimately reach it., Today he woke up
and saw himself in the small mirror behind the  bathroom door,
and saw the cuts under his eyes,
the holes in his hands., And at that moment he knew
that the body is not flesh, it does not feel.
That it is made of sand instead. And it runs out., from Light and After (deep south, 2010), Survival, We who accept survival as our password
accept incompleteness as our blessing.
We who dress in blindness and in faith
do not know the colour of our palms
nor the weight of our feet upon the water.
We who have dust in our mouths all day
have stones on our tongues instead of songs.
We who quench fire with fire all night
know that wings are not the only ladder
to the dark, that heavy wood swims too
in the tide of the wind.
We who accept survival
accept survival as our curse., from Light and After (deep south, 2010), The Foot, The foot is a hole.
A stone.
A black stone.
A hole made by the stone
before the hole was made.
A hole that the stone cannot get out of,
no matter how black, and blacker still,
its skin goes .ì
Until its skin begins to crack, and
pieces flake off.
Chunks of rock falling into
the black hole that the foot grows
beneath its shadow., The foot is a stone.
Underneath the stone is a hole
that spreads and shrinks and
spreads again as the wind blows., The hole smells like words left a long time
in the crevice between two teeth.
Like words that have been closed up
too long in the dark pit of the mouth.
Sweating all night. And sleepless
in the day., The foot is a hole made by a shard
of memory.
It walked through black mud
one morning on the edge of a brown lake,
where the birds waded deep up to their cries,
up to their blue wings.
It walked through the black mud and
into the lake.
And the water was not cold,
the foot said.
Come in, the foot said. The water is warm.
Look.
And it bent and scooped up the old skin
from off the surface of the lake and
threw it up into the air., And the flakes of water flew.
And the flakes of water fell.
And the foot came up out of the water
and it was red.
It was red where the flakes of water
had fallen upon it and cut it .ì
called out to it its new name., Its new name was loss.
And rot., The foot remembers the brown lake
always, and longs to return
to the warm water, to the impenetrable depths,
lurking with the voices of fishes., It remembers the brown lake
with its long waving hair and its green eyes,
and the foot wants to laugh again, loudly,
the way the long grass does.
The foot wants to laugh again.
But there is a hole.
There is the hole made by the red stone
that does not heal. Ever.
The hole that never closes over.
Even when it seems to., I hold the foot in my hand every night,
spit onto it.
I spit into its red hole and
mix the spit with sand and honey,
and pack it full. I pack the hole full
every night, and when I go to sleep
I dream that the hole is growing a skin over it.
That a wide bridge is falling out of the sky,
and that it lands on the foot,
and that it covers the deep distance
between the edges of the red hole., The foot pretends that it has something to say.
That the fishes in the brown lake and
the birds in the air and the stones, too,
in the black desert
want to hear what it has to say., But to be honest,
it has all been said before., from Light and After (deep south, 2010)"

Recently he has started an initiative called Giants in the Land which has so far published two books of poetry. He is currently working on his first novel.",Nigeria,"Winking in the dark is a futile act
the wind whispers.
But I told a joke to a deaf man
who laughed hysterically
and gave me the thumbs up.
I danced for a blind man
who clapped and said
.òmy boy, one day you will be the greatest dancer on the earth for your dance reminds me of years gone when my eyes were with me.'
But the wind whispered
.òtwo people do not lose in a lie if the one being lied to does not know he is being lied to, the one lying knows he is lying.'
.òWhen the rabbit grows old he sucks the nipples of his young.'
The wind whispered., But I have stood upon the shoulders of those who came before me.
Now I must strengthen mine for the ones to come.
So like a fatherless son I wonder how to be a man:
Should I take a wife?
And sire a son?
Do I take a gun?
And take a life?
How is it done?
But the wind whispers,

ABUSE
I am very sad; I have been hurt by evil people
Evil people who make life unbearable
Behold, I am being struck by pain underneath my heart, I cannot hold it
I am thinking about the past, when my feelings were like troubled waters
A saying goes what goes around comes around
There is still more to come, I am warning you
Once words have been said, they cannot be reversed
Mother I am crying, yes I am crying for unity
(Ululations)
I am crying for unity, I am crying for cooperation
I am crying for the love I missed in my childhood
My soul was abused, troubled, exhausted
My mother and father lived a tedious lifestyle
When parents have tension, it automatically gets to the children
Helpless as I was with my siblings
We could not utter a word, like sheep we endured it all
Oh mother, I am crying for unity
(Ululations)
Tears we shed like Rachel
Crying like a sheep for its lambs
We turned into things that we could not be
Abuse is a monster that completely destroys peace and harmony
Our home was covered in darkness
My mother died bearing my father`s whips
My father turned wild and wandered away
Abuse you are a murderer and anti-progressive
Oh mother, I am crying for unity
(Ululations)
Oh mother, I am crying
Can you plead with the creator to strike with thunder those anti-peace
Those who do not want harmony in the world
Mother, talk to the creator to unite the nation
And take men to Men Sector
And empower women with rights to be right and righteous
So that we the giants could admire them
Oh mother, I am crying for unity
Plead with the creator to answer my prayers
Oh mother

"Kyle's poetry is by no means conventional; it does not follow grammar rules or structure. It definitely won't go down in history as some of the best-written work. Kyle does not care about that! He cares about changing people's perspective on topics of the mind and spirit, topics like society norms, love, and social media. He cares about sharing that feeling you get when you hear something that resonates with you, when the goosebumps shoot up your arms and that inspirational shiver slides down your spine. He wants people to be able to relate on a human level and say, .úI understand where he is coming from because I feel the same emotions he does on a daily basis..ù",South Africa,"When I first see her my heart hums a lullaby and my body goes numb. That's the codeine, which drops you as you fall to sleep. When the morphine takes hold vision becomes blurry, I am unable to distinguish between the seen or unseen, is this reality or a serene dream scene of me playing tambourine on a trampoline, jumping for joy to the sound of music., As she approaches my heart begins to beat like a drum. That's the caffeine, I attempt to counteract the noise in vain by lighting a cigarette and hoping the nicotine will flow through my veins. No use. This substance has already begun to take a toll, already begun to take control, perhaps cheap alcohol will enable me to let loose. That's a rich excuse! I decide to let down my defences drop all my pretences and as I do my jaw tenses. That's the methamphetamine, that bitch is mean! Once you are dirty you cannot get clean there is no vaccine no place to run or hide no quarantine. I have only myself to blame, so I recede into the bathroom stall of my brain and re-run line after line after line, that's the cocaine! Flush these negative thoughts down the drain there is no shame in meaning what you say, just have fun with it and swallow your pride. That's the MDMA!, She is almost here now and my heart drops the bass, I am rushing. That's the adrenaline! When we finally stand face to face and embrace my god that's the heroin!, She opens her mouth and my heart begins to sing, I inhale the THC of her words and puff out a ring with a beautiful diamond of LSD. I am engaged with the most dangerous drug of all .¶ L.O.V.E, I have researched the internet of my mind to find these side effects. May include but are not limited to the following:, Sweaty palms, out stretched arms. Shivering, quivering, delivering from pain, shifting blame. Crying, laughing, laughing till you cry, being shy, telling a lie, honesty. Gentle breathing, nervous heaving, Goosebumps that start to run up your spine, orgasms that will blow your mind, words that are sometimes hard to find, stealing a heart, committing a crime, breaking in braking through breaking up. Clumsiness, silliness, being generous. Giving, receiving, taking hugs, kisses, rejection, dismisses. Feeling blessed. Feeling stressed. A calming walk in a forest filled with trees, smell the flowers, the birds and the bees and in all this craziness I am weak in the knees. A soft bottom lip, I stumble over my words. This drug is a trip., She glides as if she is walking on water, Jesus! I am battling to stay afloat, doubt as sharp as an iceberg enters my mind and I search franticly to find a whistle to blow in this ice cold see, but it's pointless. This time there is no life boat to come and rescue me., I become drowsy and start to drown in this drug, overdose on kisses and hugs as they warm my heart. Shrug it off Kyle! Wake up, you are only dipping your toe into a pool, you promised yourself you would never take another drug again in your life. You almost died once. Don't be a fool!, I have dealt with hits of love before, usually to the gut. Waking up on my bedroom floor six months later eating ice-cream and feeling stuck in a sticky rut. I screamed for love to leave me alone to pass through my system, I have even attempted cold turkey but that bitch won't listen, so I decided to make it my mission. I began to deal with all sorts of customers, tall, short, rough, and gentle ones to. Betting on people's lives all for a rand or two, racking in their money and not worrying about the consequences or caring about the damage, as long as I was winning I was always able to manage. Roulette wheeling and blackjack dealing with users, love abusers. Hoping this spin will change their fortune or this hand would make things right. Gambling with their hearts even though they have been losers all their life., It's true what they say what goes around comes around, because I have found that when I come round love goes, as well as my obsession. Possession is nine tenths of the law but I have no more breath to possess. I have overdosed on love even after I promised myself no more drugs., So looking forward., Perhaps this whole time it has not been the drug, but rather the dealer. My god you should see her! I am grateful for seeing this new found realisation and have decided to remain faithful to this graceful heavenly sent being that speaks half English and half angel."

",Tanzania,"Glorious rain reminds me of
something true,
thunderous pain reduced to a
grainy residue,
washed away in jazzy notes
of tender blue., Its not in vain if nothing
obscures the view,
if warmth is shared through
and through
and if the grasp of embrace
leaves a trace.¶, All that's missing is you.¶, A cool rainy night like this
demands endless lovemaking
to exhaustion
to distraction
like a frenzied dance
that doesn't happen by chance
but thick with enchantment
oozing silence with
few requirements other than
guttural vocal satisfaction
when experiencing god's given
endowments
over and over., No stopovers
no tag team maneuvers
one on one
one on glorious one
one on intimate one.
Enrapture captured."

For him, I am delicious, each time, But being the secret beneath a music man's tongue
Will leave you ravenous. You realise , That you do not compel him to language
You realise

Leaves me with no choice
But to rejoice
Your voice echoes in the hemispheres of my brain
Like sharp yet gentle drops of the rain
It balances the left and the right to perfect meditation
Synchronising our spirits with a deep flow of emotion
As you speak your voice pierces through my ears
The wind that sweeps away all my fears
Your voice speaks in tongues only you and I can understand
Your voice sends us to our own wonderland
A dreamland architecture(d) by God's hand
Your voice resonates with peace, love and harmony
Your voice proves that we'll never know sorrow or agony
As you speak your voice sails me to the edges of hallucination
Your voice is the only way to my emancipation
The drug of tranquillity coursing through my veins
Gently driving away all my pains
And breaking up all these chains
Keep on speaking and free my spirit
Heaven knows that I need it
Talk-talk and let me hear your tongue click-click
When you speak even the clock ceases to tick
Melodious as it is, your voice could have been a guitar lick
A harmonious blend of jazz and blues,
That's what your voice is
It reflects the beauty that extols nature
So let's talk about our future
Your voice reveals that our path is clear
As you whisper sweet words into my ear
Words that clatter like the hooves of a jubilant horse
Unbelievable that they come from a human source
Your voice is like the tiny giggle of a golden bell
Leaving me captivated by the magic of your spell
Breathe in, breathe out
And listen to what it's about
Your voice scatters seeds of happiness
In the garden of our togetherness
The fire that warms up the cold winter
Like diamonds in the black sky you will always glitter
To you I bow
So hear me now
When you speak, I'm left with no choice but to worship your voice
Because in your voice, I rejoice"

I am born the same year you are born .ì 1926
And so much has happened and yet, so little .ì Fiddlesticks!
I am an immigrant. I shall always be an immigrant.
I walk like an immigrant. I talk like an immigrant.
I am an immigrant from my tip to my toe., This word Immigrant, you know how it was born?
It emerged from the word Migrate. Migrate.
First prescribed as a description of what birds do.
And how free are they? I am an immigrant like the birds., See. A boy said to me that his zaidy said to him,
Reach of the top of the tree and you get to the first branch.
But reach for the stars and you get to the top of the tree.
So, here is Britain, this beautiful earth, and here is the sky
And here are the stars., What if for one moment in one day we reach for the stars?
What if you uncurl your heart as we uncurl ours
And spread your arms open wide as we spread ours?
What if for one moment in one time on one day
We reach out to all and beyond and say.
With the power to draw in the warmth of the sun,
Let it be. Let them come. Let it be. Let them come., Let them come with their baklava, their coffee and teas.
Like Moses let us lead. Let us all lead.
Let them bring their hymns and their prayer beads.
Let them wear the saints in gold around their necks.
Let them bring their grief and their good, their kismet.
Let them bring their stories and their laughter.
Speak of Christmas and Ramadan and Hanukkah.
Let them ring their church bells, let their muezzin call., Let the cacophony ring true and ring through to us all.
Let it be. Let them come. Let it be. Let them come., Let them throw down their seeds and let freedom flower.
Let them speak their own language as we speak ours,
So that they might learn the language of tone and trust,
The blessed language of the body and the face .ì the language of us.
The language of listening. Because these things speak more
Than the clumsiness of words. Let them come, I implore.
Let them exchange our customs and let it be customary to exchange.
Let them come like the beautiful life-giving rain.
I shall wear the yarmulke, they shall wear the cloth.
I shall wear the talit, let them wear the cross.
From the churches, the mosques, the synagogues,
Let them come in the name of their gods., Let them come. It is you that visited them. You.
For whom the sun would never set.
Let us decolonise our minds: Live free, yet, never forget.
You who scoured the world (for who?) like a dragnet plunging
Into the waves catching all and sundry lunging into slaves.
It was you who counted the bounty and threw the rest overboard.
Ruling the waves indeed by gun by God by sword., These British cities thrive today on the cash flow from then.
Then let's address the current, the strong strong current, then.
Lest we stand, as we are, with hands frozen to the gun
On the beaches, in this code red autumnal sun:
Like a kingdom stunned.
Let the knots of history come undone., Lest we stand, as we are, with hands frozen to the gun
On the beaches, in this code red autumnal sun:
Like a kingdom stunned.
Let the knots of history come undone.
Let your people finish what your people begun.

At my disapproval and drive past, while people stare at you aghast

",Botswana,"We do not usually see the darkness at such hours
Not so early.
We see the sun,
She travels to places we only hear of
We don't really know that they exist.
Like the voice on the radio,
We think she has gone to sleep;
To gather heat
In the belly of the earth., So when we saw darkness,
Blindingly asserting entitlements
To times which should belong only to the sun,
We shut our doors behind us,
Covered the children in heavy sheets.
This, they should not see., A day
Half asleep., The moon is usually half awake
At such hours.
He readies himself to
Shut his eyes and wait
For a new month to serve,
And the stars stretch themselves wider on those eves,
Stark crystals against the carpet of sky., We used to understand.
We used to know what time it was.
We used to tell the stories to the children,
In songs around the fire.
We used to hope to hear them told on the radio,
While we lay on our beds
And the barren fields were far away.
We used to wait. , But the darkness did not ask for permission.
She gathered the heaviest of clouds.
No thunder.
No questions.
Covered the sun,
It was not going to rain.
Darkness was tired of always waiting
For Day.
The children slept through it.
They will never know., We stayed awake
Behind closed doors.
We will not forget."
Leungo Frank is a poet based in Gaborone Botswana.,Botswana,"When you hold my hand
I disappear
Just as Cleopatra met her end
At the hands of a man
You undo me, The intricate laces and buttons
I liked to assume I had
Become snaps that help
You take me apart
You pull me to pieces
To the point where
I get lost in the vague
Interspace between dream and reality
And slip into the oh so
Comfortable trance that lets
Me be brave enough to walk
In on myself being exiled
From my long and broken village
For the thirtieth time in the day
And actually allow myself to walk away, When you touch me
All my worries take on a
Metaphysical impalpability
Sinking to minor cerebral
Phenomena for quiet contemplation
In place of standing as pressing
Concretions that chafe the body and soul
I am metamorphosed into an
Ambitious butterfly not afraid to
Flutter by and show off my
New painted on colours
My Picasso plays with
Permanent markers on my back
And makes good work of glossing
Over the deathmarks left on my skin
The kaleidoscope makes me forget
That the weakness of my
Constitution makes mountains of
My petty sins, When you look at me
Every time you blink you leave
A fragile trail of butterfly
Kisses which, when followed,
Lead me to the momentary
Threshold of womanhood and
They gently push me in heart first
Glancing over my shoulder
I see phases of my childhood
That lurk in me still
Whispers from hidden cocoons
Remind me to hold on to
Those snatches of little girl
Even as I come into my own
In the blinding and surreal
Light of your eyes, When you hold my hand
I disappear
And just as Cleopatra met her
End at the hands of a man
Deliciously, you undo me"

I dangle limbs over a warmed balcony to watch
A moustached florist lingering in his dusting
To tease kittens with his broom, or perch
By neon storefront to take twenty year's tea
With the barber next door, behind the fish market
On Sahme Sokak, a name I find new ways to butcher
Daily. Offal sneaks in behind the stink of construction, And does me harm; I hasten northwards, face shattered,
To cool heels at the flood-lines the flow of money has left
Moving through this place, evaporating
Around houses hollowed by old fires and bad times
Not wholly past. A dog bites at its patchwork flank
And the street-beaten man beside it bites at his nails,
Between trying to sell me batteries and sharing
Two jokes weakly with a greengrocer.
I bite my nails too., They tell me not to come here at night,
Forgetting the daylit dangers; the firebombed
Pharmacy with a floor constellated by glass,
Or the calls to prayer that go unanswered,
Or the women above, congealed by their window-sills,
Or the trains that don√≠t go by here any more.All I have to do is turn, Around, and go as I came; the cracked stone
Neighourhood will rush in to fill the void in my wake,
Unsurprised at my retreating back, and I can point
A camera at a square that was a cemetery that was
A garden that was a field of battle. All ruins used?to be something else, once., Two kids run by, and I am invisible. Mothers or aunts
Look on; making some kind of life here on cobblestones
Older than my name. They may look at this street,
And see more of what could have been than what is,
But neither view includes me.I am a diver seeing how deep
I can go before air,
A child extending the number of blocks
I can run away from home before taking fright
And turning back.A tourist. I couldn't live in this place.
It is not hard to find ruins here."

That are written in silence, on their hearts
Printed on their palms and repeated in their footsteps
That stretches from As to Zs of life, Sins of our mothers
That when we discover them we don't not hate our mothers
But simply forgive the sisters and thank them for what they did
What they did in darkness, behind bushes, on river banks
In closed offices, at back seats of heavy trucks, rest rooms
On dry grass, plastic shacks, wet floors,, Sins of our mothers
That has made them big time liars, cheaters, whores, haters, murderers
Yet we know them as loving, caring, passionate and sweet
That makes them desert their loved ones in the night
Only to return at wee hours of a new dawn
Instead of pick and paying
They pick and smuggle, Excising the shopping right
To provide the next meal for their children, Sins of our mothers
That makes them go out for a hunt
No matter how cold it is
They pray for a catch before corks start to crow
And this catch should be loaded
If not them they have to endure two more catches
For a decent take away home
And next thing, they pay for their children√≠s tuition fees, Sins of our mothers
Who force their little sons to fend for the family
Only because their fathers died with leaving a penny behind
These boys experience fatherhood without enjoying being teenagers
They stretch their backs digging trenches, pick tea, apples
With the sun heating on them with no mercy
For them it pours, Sins of our mother
Are bruises she got from that cheating bustard
When she laid there naked
Had to deal with his big joy stick that forced itself into her
His groans and moans on top of her can never be erased in her mind
But what to do when her little John needs a penny for a cola when he is with his friends, Sins of our mothers
Who give their teenage aged daughters to men who are older than the fathers
In exchange of bread and a kanga cloth or a bar of soap
Our mothers who let their daughters change men as the way they change their G-strings
For sugar and milk for their tea
Yet they do not tell them to protect themselves when they are out there
They do not prepare them of the concrete world, Sins of our mothers
Who let their boyfriends sneak into their daughter√≠s rooms
In the middle of the night
For a game of hide and seek
For our mothers simply wants to provide a roof for their children
If these boyfriends are stopped they threaten to walk away, Sins of our mothers
Who abort their of the sixth foetus
Because they are not coping with the 5 children
That they already have.
They cannot feed them, clothe them
Or just offer them a right to their education
Since of our mothers
Who lie to you about the DNA tests
Make you believe that these children are yours
Simply because they know it only you who can take care of her children, Sins of our mothers
Who now rote on their deaths bed
Because HIV became their newest companion
That are never told to us
That are written in silence, on their hearts
Printed on their palms and repeated in their footsteps
That stretches from As to Zs of life"

To this surge of coldness
When the warmth
Rests behind the earth's ears
Put down your arms
Let your limbs hang
Into a puddle on the ground
Surrender, Surrender
Bury yourself deep
In the dark
That you fall into
When you have hit the rock
Of emotions
Your roots seek
But you fear
Give into
The gravity of the unlit
Till the light knows
You are home
And starts flickering
Back on
Surrender, Surrender
Let the storm of dying leaves
Catch up with you
And as they go to respite
Allow them to take you
Go home
Wither and die
Return to the stillness
Of the soil
Of the peace
In between the notes
The flowers sing
As they bloom
Surrender, Surrender
Un-laden yourself
Of reactivity
Evaporate
And join the clouds
In their rest
Above the sky
And when respite
Has harvested
Your lassitude
Fall down
To this outside dance
Of that old tale
Where
You sit at the stoop
And wait for
Perfect moments
Surrender, Surrender
To this perceived
Fire of suffering
Let it take you home
Back to the stillness
of the soil
to the light
of the darkness.
Surrender"

as frost, as frozen earth, compact as stone, rough-grained
as granite, vulnerable as a bud opening
in a gale, or as a still-slippery
newborn foal, Who will bash our breaths out in one

with a hooked salmon's flash, twist the way we'd seen a lark
to a manic floating spark, fire a frozen tractor into a gleeful
life, now that Ted Hughes
is dead?"

This forest is so flawed because I rose but eventually fell on the orchard.
See these orchids with dying anthers that I depict in my anthology.¶
I lose them all, because I found the anomaly normally I parody but this piece
is an authentic analogy. As I gazed through the forest glades I saw light
for the rest of my days, though the world has become a hazy view to such bliss miss
was clear as day and sum will see how.¶ how high this crane flower rose
when these beautiful flowers that hail from berry trees but their insides
spring forth such a fierce juice I see error in their synthesis.¶ fall
coz they front like a rose in a park, she's the real wine of the forest heart
the rest hangs on the grape vine, but as she drenches her pears in her waters
it seems lily is divine matter for the forest, indispensable, and I'm into deep
I drown in the kiss of her two lips because she's that flower with indelible composition
and botanists  have orbited the globe trying to figure what her comp is
but the cardinal points to the ascension. Fly bird of paradise!
You are up rooted, expunged from the turf of vanity you are uprooted
but still devoted to how you were brought up, rooted in the turf of sanity.
This new route we walk is so scenic, I thank God for the edge in me to search
over the hedge because whatever was purged was restored the violet that immerged
out of the blue when my life was dark, and now it's so vivid
the blue lit in the dark because sometimes you don't get it how you live it."

I live in a bed of days and paper
between the threads of a graying sweater
strands of yarn raveling out. I've
never been far from my gospels., Hours weave, and I collect words
a graveyard of pens and discarded notes
I am slow moving and unholy. , I sink in the discomfort
wear it in like this old sweater
frayed and ill fated
I am fragile in this disorder., PAPER NESTS
fishing wasps from an arm
they come humble
stingers first like a filial sacrifice , watch these ugly children find wings
rattle into the light
one by one , an army from a vein
black, crackling
leaving no signs on the body, building somewhere
paper nests from nothing but
gnawing and compulsion, SAMSON
We could feign living in truth's garden
I could conjure us flowerbeds and briery , the thorns can draw blood if they'd like
just lead me through your side of a sun, My inception began with clean things
chewed of substance in the heat, you bury my toes in an offering
your strands at my feet"

Who stand with their backs
On these walls
Step up front and jazz
And You.¶
Who stand facing the exit
Step outside,
And dance to your nightmares
This moment comes once
You..
Who love to hear words
Turning into beats
That silence the violence in our streets,
Raise your fists
And ignite those lighters
For those that fought and died
In the name of peace
Love like revolution has no age
So please plant that sensitive seed with love
From an early stage.
I lost my father to the wind
Before I could write to understand
Before I could be a man
Though my mother taught us
How to walk with the sun on our hands
And that blood is thicker than water
For us to fight with ourselves any longer.
.òHome is where the fire burns for us all'
So look at your self first
And keep the peace at home young soldier
Unchain your heart from street politics
And listen to her when she speaks
Life wasn't meant to be easy
Even for the rich.
On a table of discipline and respect
I learned,
The price for happiness is painful
For years we hid our struggles and pains
Behind illusive smiles and angry tears of joy
And in our homes some of our parents
Passed on this struggle to some of us
Who refused to encourage it
Rather we learn from it
While respecting the opportunities it gives
Yet everyday we lose beautiful flowers from it
So You..
Who hate guns,
Where u at?
You
Who says no to drugs
Where u at?
Cos the good die innocent
And the young rot in jail
For hustling a cent,
Someone please fax me some sense,
Soweto is now an amusement park for tourists.
Well singing cows are good for the country
But without free education
The innocent die young
Trying to get that cheese.
My parents were not rich
And as artists,
Life was not always bliss,
Though they hustled us food
And made everything seem good.
Point is
Truth has no boundaries
And survival by any means
Is a fact that lives to haunt economists.
Today white business,
Is now on the black market
Giving birth to dealers everyday
On our televisions and billboards on the highway
Who is the target?
Too many thugs in our pockets
Ripping us off
And talking black empowerment
So you
Who stand with their backs
Against these brainwashed walls
Step up front
And lets go tag our names
On the president's heart.
Leave signs and posters over the parliaments art
That shout, .òFree education for all'."

This poem takes us into a mind of a poet that is riddled with self-doubt, anxiety and words that will not come. The poet finds it very challenging to pursue this art form amid societal pressures, naysayers, limited resources, negative thoughts and .úthe changing seasons of life.ù."
"Malibongwe Omega Snyman, also known as .úThe Lazzy Poet.ù was born and raised in Eastern Cape, South Africa. He has performed his .ústreet poetry.ù on various platforms.Lazzy Poet's latest brainchild and achievement has been his collaboration with, LoveLife, an NGO that deals with HIV, teenage pregnancy and various other social issues.He is also the founder of Poetic Expressionz, a platform established to showcase the artistic work of the youth in his home town.",South Africa,"Behold!!!
The Lazzy Poet is coming through!
The ultimate concept solicitor, out to level scores with you and your crew!
Reviving spiritual intellect with mind, body &amp; soul acupuncture.
Sequel to paramedical pinnacle resuscitation of knowledge and wisdom,
Reinstating the importance of deeper and higher meditations and conversing with the most high.
Molesting concepts like Michael Jackson was a saint and never a pedophile.
All these words; the metaphors, figures of speech &amp; the verbs
That the Lazzy Poet's page put together, let no man put asunder!!!
It then comes as no wonder that no one has ever bothered,
So why look so astound now?
Truth &amp; reality is of a foreign kind now? Huh?
So I might in the speed of light
Greet my kind of likeness
To elevate your relevance to mind highness
And bring you closer to the most supreme highest.
Greetings your highnesses!
So this whole verse is a mixed verse, a blank verse
With a whole lot of mixed concepts like fine art and the universe
As my infinite canvas during the night.
Pacing these words, lacing this verse.
Changing my thoughts to develop my mind.
That is power is enough to threaten dynasties
And changing galaxies, to chop &amp; change stars in alignment
Like moving furniture in your own private confinements.
My poetic expressionz and I are on a quest to revolutionize
The whole concept of hotspots
Programming our youth, into snotkops and mofkops;
Transforming our young kids into drunkies, junkies and then illiterate monkeys.
To neutralize the ideology of relaxing you at home, popping some corn
And empathise with fake tears of million dollar making movie stars
.¶look who is getting cornier by the minute!
Thee objective is to tame the your appetite for knowledge and wisdom
And give you visual and mental obesity,
By giving you televised junk and obscurity
All in the name of culture and diversity
Whilst feeding you westernized ideology.
So in attempt to counter towards victory,
.¶Mobilize seek knowledge and the light and avoid the trickery.
Each one, teach one and learn to empower on another, for that is the power of WORD!
So my poetic expressionz gave me another horse ride beyond infinity;
To illustrate further on this .úmaster &amp; slave.ù interaction between Expressionz &amp; I.
To my complete surprise I found a complete paradox of what the universe looks like;
With subliminal energies &amp; messages coming from the other side of infinity to ours.
Leaving that part of the universe as clean canvas, but when I started working
Expressionz insisted I await upon a time where I shall reach my prime.
And that is the power behind WORD for WORD is bond!!!!!"

penetrate her shroud
solitary silhouette
standing on a dark mound
waiting for her moon, veiled in night
slowly she lets her head fall back
her mouth opens into the black
a soundless shout
a flock of doves flies out
dispersing into the darkness
carrying their messages
to distant quarters, in her silence she is calling
each receiver's name
all over the world they awaken
those leaving
stay
those dying
begin to breathe again
those warring
feel a tender wind unclench their fists
lighten their weapons
wash across their brows, now light peels in
defining earth from sky
she releases one more muted cry
the air absorbs it instantly
persistent as her shadow
it takes in everything, with this dawn unfolding
she finds her feet again
frees them from the red earth enveloping them
and takes her first step, with each one the rain obediently responds
gently it begins to touch her shoulders
her head
her cheeks
gradually dripping into the arc of her back
dancing on her outstretched arms
pooling in her open palms, the further she walks
the harder it pours
erasing her footprints
soaking her skin
listening for her command
for when to end this cleansing, she alone can hear the music
of her heart
her breath
her feet
beating the growing river of red, through the mist
above the mountains ahead
a rainbow like a dream
faintly emerges
beckoning her to the other side, she follows her heart-breath-beat
and feet
they know the way
they will not stop
not until the dark descends again
when time will play her trick
of dejavu, *This poem came from a dream shortly after visiting the majestic Tradouw's Pass in the Klein Karoo for the first time, in July 2005. The pass was first constructed by Thomas Bain in 1873. A 14km drive, it follows the deep valley of the Buffeljags River. Although the pass was renamed to Southey Pass (after a former Colonial Secretary), the indigenous Khoi San poeple kept referring to it as Tradouws Pass (from taras, a woman and daos, a poort) and that is the name by which it is known today."

",South Africa,"Mother, I have come to collect your spirit from the gutter,
where you marriage has left you for dead.
I am returning your body parts from their original language
they do not come from Latin
You weren't derived from Greek translations,
but you remind me of the G
Goddess, patron of Athens
Your name begins with a Capital city
in a Village like Eden
Eve is just a farm girl
carrying holy water on her head
with a bucket from the valley of the shadow of her death, She lives hand to mouth
scrapes cents to build her paradise
the land of milk and honey, requires money.
Apples are expensive not deadly
and Eve sometimes sells them for less.
Downtown, Babylon, Johannesburg., Where churches stand, on our promised stolen land
my people raise their hands like the Bible holds them under arrest
anything you say will be held against you on judgment day,
but we're judged everyday
by the colour of our sin
our skin can't repent for being black.
Mary is a domestic worker scrubbing floor with Jesus on her back
He is washed in our blood
we were crucified, so he could live a privileged life., We were never saved
Adam sold us out.
Apartheid was born again
at the altar under Christian names
like Joshua, Jesus and James
where art the apostles Ayanda, Lulama, Tisetso,Mpho?, Thy will can't be done on earth
coz their Heaven don't teach black pride to our prodigal sons at birth
Church is a placebo effect
A scripture a day, doesn't keep the hunger away.
What scriptures did we believe in before Christ
How many of our Gods have been crucified on their cross,
we've all been sacrificed
in the name of our fathers
who walked out on their creation
to serve the spirit in bear bottles
calling on Moses to testify, that the burning bush
the burning bush, is a holy herb and we must all smoke.
He is high on Heaven, believing Armageddon is the end of the world
when it is the end of the world inside our souls
that makes us bow our heads to the lord
believing white Jesus can save black souls
coz he died on the cross., Biko died in police custody
he left a verse In the hands of the oppressor
the most potent weapon ios the mind of the oppressed
Deliver yourselves from evil
you re the answers to your prayers., Sobukwe died for a clause
so you could remember, the power and the glory in your name
because they failed to give it back.
Preserve the black in your body like in to a history deserving the truth.
The biggest hell, is that of self-doubt
Heaven is a place where you go to learn to love yourself., My mother is a verse that reminds me of self.
Thato Tsoeu 1: 2 said .úlet there be light in our hearts.ù
So she raised us like pyramids
we are growing synagogues
here to worship at the house of her Cathedral
her body is my temple
I was made in her image
I have bedroom eyes at the windows of her soul where she sees right through me
when they say Jesus is coming
tell the my mother is already here.
When her spirit comes down, I pray in mother tongues
.úweh mangikuhlabela lenkonzo usaphila name.ù, Mother.
I am slaughtering half my lungs to give you all my breath
in the name of our black Gods that never rose from the dead
I will believe in white Jesus when he comes back
bearing Biko on the cross
and we can bow our heads to that"

Still lying to the ones that never asked me to explain myself,
Crying wolf in purple vain,
Because it rained again
And it washed away the web I'd spun in orange silk
The slippery kind of orange, All the stray bullets are drawn to me, suggesting other ways of dying
dodging all the people I've been lying to
The ones that never asked me to explain myself
This poem was the one that was going to heal me., I'm not healed yet I'm passive and proud I can't make this decision
I'm looking for exaggerated ways of dying
I'm still trying to be bad, pretending to be Jesus, mending broken people and making prophecies in vain
I tried, I tried to wake the dead while thy were sleeping in my bed
In orange sheets
The slippery ink of orange, All the stray bullets are drawn to me
Without explaining all these complex ways of dying
Avoiding all the people I've been trying to mend
The ones that never asked me for salvation
This poem was the revolution I wrote to free myself, I'm not free yet I'm shameful and loud like an empty vessel in passive indecision
I'm not so suicidal I said I'm contemplating ways of dying
Raging wars inside my head and my heart and it hurts again
Like finally living between orange walls
The slippery kind of orange, Where all the stray bullets are drawn to me
Between my mind and my condition I'm not sure who played the magnet
Oh these are such simple ways of dying
It shouldn't be so easy
A little more pain, a lot more faith, a little more pain.
A lot more faith, a little more faith, a little more faith."

It engages me to see it in full growth
I am somewhat surprised by the enormity of its development
How did I let this get away from me
My subconscious, although hidden, is not so subtle in its influential paradigms of confusing, emotionally stimulation interruptions.
And then, waking from dreams that are scared my events
My subconscious holds so fresh i can smell the drama on my skin.. like a new, yet familiar encounter.
I do not wake with a racing heart nor with beads of sweat upon my forehead, no
Its more of a soul-jerking alertness.
And then this soon gives way to a heaviness, one which shortens my breath and removes those smile creases from underneath my eyes,
In a paralysing panic, I lay there, hopeless
I have been robbed of a freedom which my mind once took me to.
The escape is no longer from an external drama, i can no longer run away, it is a battle within,
And I stare into a nothingness, biting my nail but not breaking it as I recycle both the dream and shocking detail it contained
I'm trying to convince myself..
A mental reassurance that all will be ok.
And then.. only one thing is certain though.
The Sub-conscious knows."

curious and neon
magic unraveling her singing braids
there was music coming off of her:
violins and batas
pianos and castanetas
sounds her momma couldn't relate to
sounds that reminded momma of sin

sienna sunflower girl
knee high
southern tinged
tangos and rumbas tickling her feet
imagine
the first time the branch of the peach tree
ripped her skin because she'd been caught
moving to some rhythm
moving to some rhythm not born of the church
it was everything-her
sound, her scent, her earthspeak-
brought the hands, the belts, the switches down
and she tried,
when she left their house,
she tried to conjure her dance again
hear the whispers under her feet
she pulled watercolors around her waist
wore amber and amethyst on wrists and shoulders
she chanted and wound her way through jazz
but no one could read the smoke signals
of her cigarettes
.údeath would be sweeter than any of this.ù
and when we met
she was 35
and I was newly born
and she was still drowning
but she gave me studios to dance in
trumpets
screaming magentas
muted blues
congas
tarot cards
modeling clay
she kept judgement in a locked box too high for me to reach
she stepped aside
my mother stepped aside
she'd evacuated her own dreams
courted death many times
when I met her
she was still drowning
but somehow
she took me to the water
and somehow
she taught me to swim."

the crying for a brother
it never ends
running into drink
into hills
into rocks
harder
so much harder
than the soft beating
of hurts
the quiet voices

his crying
he turns the ignition key
he gets onto a plane
he misses the lightning
the hope of a mother
unshaking like flowers
every spring
her soft hands in windows
almost safe
brother
not quite here
he walks out of words
no holding-place , THROUGH THE WINDOW
Long-distance buses rumble of homesickness
and journeys wrapped in green jerseys.
Out of time they pass by
and rattle my window in the early morning.
Blowing off steam at the robot, they murmur
of destinations, of endless luggage,
scalding coffee and city lights on the horizon.
Inside, I too sit wrapped in my breath,
drawing names onto the glass."

Run your fingers through her hair
Twisted her natural locks through your fingers
Or walked your fingers through the rows of braids
Just like walking through fields of corn, When did you see the true beauty of your African Woman?
Or saw a flawless dark skin?
Or kissed her natural plump lips?, From the days of slavery black women were told .ú You gotta have hair like .úMassa.ù ,
Don't want no nappy haired black as sin gal in the house.ù
The beautiful black women were kept in the cotton fields
While those that had lighter skin,
The products of the slave master s were kept as house slaves
If your hair was long and straight, without a natural crinkle it was your bonus,
a passport to heaven,
a ticket to the  illusion of freedom, Now, I hardly see an original black woman
They all seem to have become Chinese, Indian and European
Flicking about hair that is not their own
That may be from a horse, a yak or plastic factory
Afraid to show their natural beauty
Afraid because their men have been conditioned to think that a perfect woman has straight hair and fair skin
Afraid because their sisters would laugh and tease them for their tight curls
Wake up!
Have you ever really looked at the beauty of a black woman, all natural and dark?
They way her teeth and eyes sparkle in contrast to her skin
The way her hair feels soft like the ends of an ear of corn
Or woolly like that of a new born lamb
Twisting and curling itself through your fingers
True feelings exploding through the shaft of natural hair
Men! Treat a natural woman with respect
Women!  rise up for the natural woman who dared
For her inner strength and inner pride have made her able to go against the norm
To show her true self
Just the way God made her
Perfect
A beautiful black woman"

And so we were not particularly wanted
We were helped on our way by a dirty needle
Kicks, blows, high heels or simply
The strained back and the all-consuming hoe, Maybe she .ì she warm, moist and all embracing .ì
Desired us, but by consensus it was decreed
That we should not be heard, even if seen
We were crowded out
By a clamour of hungry voices, or perhaps
A rounded schoolgirl vision with a white dress
A garland and a sofa set
To welcome us if we should come again, Most of us conformed
As is the custom: in those who hung on
Our leaping was an offence, our anxious turning
Had something of presumption in it, Some of us have come back
Owiti or Wepukhule at least
But for the rest of us there is now way out
Even though the side wall of the house
No burying-place for the precious cord
We stick at it, So if you are brushed by a spider-web at nightfall
Or disturbed by the chirping of childish cricket voices
If your cow is sucked dry without a cause
Or blood-loss comes to you as disappointment
Remember us who were intended to be
And have no name to come back to"

His first volume of poems, Falling from Sleep, was published by Botsotso Publishing in 2007.",South Africa,"The north-wester plagiarises the mountain's wistfulness.
Pure meanings coagulate in the dusk light,
flail like the gale against my shirt.
Long, tiresome conversations, repeated confessions,
reveal nothing, merely an unpleasantness on the breath.
Despots and narcissists fall from grace,
scandals accumulate, like nicotine on the end of the finger.
Recollections of a light breeze on skin; broken
epiphanies, trip from branches, from wilted petals,
from smiles on unfamiliar faces on the street.
There are many things to be done,
everyday requires a task, washing of clothes,
making the bed, dusting bookshelves,
answering the door .ì a child wanting water,
a young mother needing money for baby's milk,
or for addictive drugs. There's no telling the difference.
Grief is interred in legislated silence.
The fissures are widening. I hang out washing
on a line fastened to the loquat tree.
Green finches, camouflaged by lush leaves,
serenade the splintered clouds.
Obese fruit flies raid the stamens of nascent buds.
My daily chores are abandoned.
Residues of soap powder stain my dark clothes.
In others, veins of rust run, a delta
stretching under the armpit of the fabric.
The city has dispensed with its graceless past.
There is though, no solace from the overbearing glare
of unnatural lights, and the adhering sweat of trade."

Marta is very well known for her radio show Abronet at Bisrat FM and for her role in a radio drama.,Ethiopia,"This poem is about the (sometimes) fleeting nature of romantic love, which in its stage of infatuation can awaken and deeply excite the soul. The poem is filled with images of entangled hands, inseparable lips and enticing words. But there's also a tangible layer of fear looming, the fear that this state will vanish as quickly as it appeared. The poet uses movement language to convey impermanence of romantic love."

Ugly is so vain it's all I see, I.òve seen ugly before,

Like distended bellies, like desert tongue, like callous hands due to suffrage,
Like knife wounds in back, slit throats in allies, like parted thighs and DNA scrapings,
I'm sure you've seen Ugly,
How about that 5 year old who decided to never to tell a soul on how innocence snatched made her a man child before he was six,
How silence meant everything, how snips and snails and puppy dog tails consumed him
Cause that's what little boys are made of,
What am I afraid of?
I trust no one.¶ I've seen ugliness tear forgiveness in shreds,
Shred teenage dreams into lost identities, fear faces that show affection,
Affections have no effect on affected souls that are dug out hollowed into oblivion,
I once witnessed sunsets on fiery tongues wondering if I'll ever see the sun,
I once thought I knew love, I once wanted so bad I gave all I had leaving empty,
I once promised I'll never forgiven the un-forgiven for forgiveness is no company of mine,
Have you ever hated yourself so much while loving others to death, living a tortured life dressing it up to be beautiful?
Let the medium be my writing, how many poems must I write?
How many internal deaths must I suffer?
I seen beauty in God he prepped me for radiance, God seen beauty in me,
It's that tiny splinter that causes the most pain,
It's that struggle to grow that burning tiredness that lets you know,
That wrinkle, that vein on the temple, that strain in the eye,
Free me, let me forgive, free me let me feel, free me let me touch,
Let me find that clarity, let transparency be the skin I'm in,
Let torn dreams knit like sutures,
Rekindle soul fires, heal broken wings,
Mend broken hearts, fix broken thoughts,
Clear murky waters, purify bad intentions,
Let beautiful minds shine from that clarity,
Breathe my being into existence one more time,
Let me feel how fragile life is,
Let me touch the fire, consume the flame, become the light, transcend the breath,
Set free the wind and roam the world on a single word.¶. LOVE!
And maybe then I'll be courageous enough.¶
Maybe then I'll be courageous enough.¶..
Maybe then I'll be courageous enough.¶
To forgive.¶..myself"

Je r√©aliserai le film de ma vie
Gr√¢ce √† ma jolie amn√©sie.
Je serai l'ultime com√©dien
Ce film pourra plaire aux tiens et d√©plaire aux miens.
Je ne voudrai pas qu'il plaise
Je voudrai qu'il blesse
Dans tout son aise.
J'ai pris juste le temps d'y penser
Penser sans √™tre rassasi√©
Je vois ce que l'on ne voit pas
Je crois en ce qu'on ne croit pas
Aujourd'hui, nous croyons √† nous
Nous croyons √† vous
M√™me si vous et nous sommes fous
Regardons la terre avec d√©dain
Car rien d'elle n'est serein
Mes cheveux blancs symbolisent mes combats livr√©s
Ma barbe blanchie est la raison de mon esp√©rance √©touff√©e.
Si je devais mourir pour avoir penser
Penser sans √™tre rassasi√©
Je le ferai avec habilet√©., Croyez moi ou pas
Les terres sont si ch√®res
Que bient√¥t on vendra les mers
Et on violera les fronti√®res.
J'aurais pu dire aux miens
Que je vais bien
Mais je ne suis rien
Je ne suis qu'un petit √©crivain
Qui ne vaut pas un chien
Et qui n'a m√™me rien, Croyez moi ou pas
Nous avons juste le temps d'y penser
Le monde est fait d'hommes √©go√Østes
Qui cherchent des gloires dans les yeux du temps, Croyez moi ou pas
Beaucoup voudraient donner
Toujours donner
Pour √™tre ou para√Ætre
Pour vivre ou √™tre libre, Croyez moi ou pas
Traitez-moi de rat
De chien ou de rien
De loup ou de fou
Mais j'aurais pens√©
Penser sans √™tre rassasi√©
Sous le soleil qui cuisait mes os
Sous la pluie qui pi√©tinait ma peau
Sous le regard d'hommes, je dirai que j'ai v√©cu pour croire, pour penser., Translation
Le temps d'y penser (Time to Think) is a piece that deplores the egoistic attitudes of humans .ì the constant pursuit of material possessions and other mundane things. The poet would rather see humanity focus on maximising the usage of the mind and imagination, he says, .ùIf for imagination I should die, I would gladly welcome death.ù."

Matshediso protests against the grave violation of women and girl's rights. She says, .úKe bohlola ruri, bofelo bja lefase bo fihlile.ù which means that it must the end of the world if people can commit such inhuman acts. The most terrifying thing for her is the ability these criminals have to roam amongst society as descent people whilst carrying the most evil of intentions. The poet misses the days of her youth when such acts of violence were unheard of. This is a heartbreaking but well crafted poem by Matshediso."

Pride beamed inside me despite the fact that I was born in Durban actually, but lets overlook that, it's just a slight technicality.
I can feel I'm at home as soon as I've crossed Tlokweng border posts and I'm welcomed by the nasal Dumelang of a lazy customs official
Thinking of it now, I miss home. I don't go back often though, only on special occasions, this time stamped as a South African citizen.
You  know what I've always thought as I'm filling out forms, it's a pity they don't have SADC as a nationality,
It would certainly make my life easy.
With my half Ndebele aunts and uncles I'd just write .úfrom all of the above.ù next to Country of Origin.
My life would be simple
I wouldn't have to launch into a recited summary of my personal history when asked, so where are you from?
Oh no, my mom, Zulu-born went into exile and married a Motswana man my dad,11 years and three kids later they divorced. We came back, got  S.A. passports, and had to transform,
Issues of identity became blessings of diversity, interesting stories and a collage of poetic childhood memories.
I remember the dust rising streets of scorching hot Gaborone, we grew up catching raindrops in orange plastic jugs,
Our tiny feet would thomp heavily on the ground in a rain dance, not just for fun but necessity,
Seriously, we were so thirsty, two savannahs short of a drought. Yes that's how I'd describe my home city
But we survived and felt vibrantly alive in my desert home that I deserted a long time ago, The Motswana in me comes through in my laid back sticky pap and morogo attitude ga oka mpona ke rapame mo stoeping oseka wantshwenya thlemma kea ithetsa as batswana do,
Mangifuna kodwa nginga khuluma isizulu and that is respectfully due to umama's bedtime stories which she beat into our hearts like a steady drum, always ending too soon in ncos ncos yaphela, we were still too young to see that she preserved our mother tongue, I have ancestors all over the show.
bloodlines spilling across borderposts.
I have a cousin Mazuba from Zambia,
That didn't prevent blood wars fought with family members right next door in Zimbabwe,, There's more, I even have heritage in Kenya apparently!
It's funny a friend once told me, after we had just met, her name is Awino, she smiled and said,
You know Mbali, you have the pride and nature of a Luo, She told me that Mbali isn't a flower it means .òfar' in Swahili. It moved me in a way I can't explain because far is how I feel, I am running so hard cutting across geographical invisible lines to stay safe inside the right one, i.e the one that's convenient at the time
I the nouveau African, I wear dresses handmade and mailed by a friend from Mali,
I deshell prawns with my Mozambican friends as we engage in debate about third world poverty
I say bonjour ca va to parking guards, laugh and ask will they vote Kabila if they can get back to the DRC?
In the meantime I'm calculating where to say I'm from, to whom, to seem closer to them to feel more African, without being too true about my family lineage,
Turns out my gogo is from the wrong type of Zimbo, so I hide that, and emphasise my new found Eritrean friend.
playing it easy meanwhile I'm seriously worried, the thought running through my mind is like, what if I end up dating some guy from Nigeria
I am Xenophobia.¶
I am Africa not African condemning instead of celebrating my diversity. I am the new face of Africa, cutting my nose to spite my face. I am the Hutu calling myself Tutsi in conflict with my shared heritage, instead of opening my eyes and seeing that I am self colonized, In my African fantasy I stand in the shade of a Baobab tree its smell seeps through the black and protrudes through the juice of a Marula perfectly.
Only thing wrong with this picture is that no one speaks .òAfrican' in the restaurants I frequent, this new found revolution is recent.
Truth is, the who I am, is a Cape Town city girl consuming what is termed the coca cola culture. You can feel it, it's in the long street fever where we merge on a level where we can all relate because we've all bought shares in this new South Africa
We're part of a culture that sells that all is well. We have mixed race International friends but that cosmo city ends in the CBD. Fifteen minutes out of town there's a war going on. didn't you read the headlines of the murdered Somailians. Africans killing each other what, what next? Come on, it's ridiculous. We don't' need xenophobia, what, with race, class, issues and HIV we can sustain our hate for each other for at least another century., It's a fear of what we don't understand mentality it has to stop!
Go back home you Refugee, because we choose to forget a time when we too weren't free,
We are shouting makwere kwere take our jobs, because we have millions unemployed,
It's the foreigners who sell drugs, because we need to blame others for what we have destroyed
Me included, I am struggling to choose sides because I want to be seen in my stoned cherry outfit as the one of us of the African renaissance
Shouting proudly African silently, because I don't want to be teased that I'm from upper campus. Running, panting, ten years later after pass laws holding my green ID book up.
I want to stop, pause, sink my bare feet into red African soil. Trace my blood line with my big toe, create a map no matter how far back, of my people, and find my roots so I can stand.
Dream of an Africa I claim as mine, I will fight for this continent with fierce pride because it is only I that stands between my Africa and me."

Of an imperfect society in dire need of exorcist fixtures
How can we expect freedom when led by ectoplasms of colonial thinkers?
Unleashing the plagues of ignorance and solipsistic decadence to a populace blinded by the eloquence of these colloquial speakers
Using our hopes and dreams to mask their monopolistic, imperialist ideas If every language is a culture then they've extracted our wisdoms To generate genetically degenerate isms Mutant truths, muting youth, the prisons
Are schools where troops, trod-out-from as uncouth-lost-sons, the schools of thought-that-starved Mashinini's legacy
And coincidentally Seahlolo died shortly after a pain in the tummy, tell me something Like how all these fantasy fallacies have actually fractured the facts we see This is the matrix of a generation of rebels with no cause and conformist babies The making of dwarfed minds where retarded thoughts are as contagious as rabies Intelligence broken down like the syndrome of an extra chromosome, let's face it Reality's trapped in dreams, we wake up to fantasies
Whose fruits we'll never reap cause the death of humanity has made us live in bubbles like Fanta, see
The renaissance of Africa's the asymptote we'll never reach For as long as we rely on the current systems to teach The systems that left open scabs on Tsietsi's legacy But used Hector Peterson's blood to rewrite history
How can the youth be the future when it's nothing but the image of a dead teen? That's used to pursue your inner genius so you can be a great being?"

That I will marry when I want
For the beautiful ones are not yet born
While we wait for the rain
In the coming of the dry season
Behind the anthills of savannah,
Milking the cows of Shambati, gathering good bits of wood,
And the fortunes of Wangarini, in the forests with a thousand demons
A sleep walking land, for things had fallen apart
We faced the wrath of the ancestors, bones and shadows
For it was not any easy walk to freedom
With Farai's girls, Nehanda and the son of the soil,
In that long journey of popynongena, we met Matigari,
And the tycoon from Peter Maritzburg, and the poor Christ of Bomba
We saw the devil dangling on the cross and his blooming petals of blood
We had the arrows of God
We wanted to kill the mangy dog
In the river between was this a war of freedom?
Indaba my children
We sang the song of Lawino and Ocol
Walking down Second Avenue
Fighting to decolonize the minds of the people
We became the house of hunger
In the country of our own
The butterfly was burning
In the burning summer season, we never ate the grain of wheat
For we harvested thorns and nervous conditions
Cry my beloved country, country of my skull
Nehanda still snores even after the struggle of Zimbabwe."

That we are energies who reflect themselves in the sky to look at each other at night., I want to pay homage to I and those who walk the same path as I.
Those who infuse their eyes with yours to make you see the world in theirs.
Who utter naked words because truth haunts them, and truth is an oath that will bring you closer to God than any religion ever will.
Whose tongues decipher musical notes into lullaby√≠s of Hope for single mothers and fatherless children.
Who use nature to curve their words into shapes and images that even language struggles to comprehend.
Play Cd-Jays and Vynals with a single hand.
Turn abandoned walls into galleries, strike chords and keys, play strings to heal broken souls
Those who know that air gives life to melody and that music is a universal language., I want to pay homage to I and those who walk the same path as I.
Those who know that exposure is a Trojan horse that leaves them wondering when is exploitation going to end.
Whose music still make our playlists but died poor and penniless, Branda Fassie and Mahlathini.
Those who left their families cursing and hating the path we have chosen forbidding their children to embrace the same journey.
Blinding their future by having a blurry vision to the present as a side effect of the past.
Those who are sometimes declared unstable or banned from their countries because of they have to say.
Artists who exhibit their hearts and minds uncensored, who know that Rain is God overwhelmed by Art.
Every tear drop carrying a message for his chosen children, strengthening us to never give up
We are soldiers who do not conform to society norms of a nine to five answering calls, because this our call, our vocation.
I want to pay homage to I and those who walk the same path as I."

I have climbed down
barefooted, just like you
to where the heat
from the sun-baked rock
blankets the sound
to claw the dry earth
and lose myself in the silence.
We are kindred, you and I,
stretched out
on the edge of the world,
sharing the vertical views
between treetops and sky,
storing time with the sunshine
in our skins., DAD AND THE PIGEONS, My father wages war
on the birds and the crickets, that make our garden home,
or so my mother tells me;, Each day a new report
of restless nights spent hunting, the sounds of crickets
who are never where their voices are,, and water gun battles with the pigeons
who come seeking shelter., Perhaps once he was content
to let the sounds sooth the night,, the wild things nestle close.
Now he demands a tidy silence., Now he stills the singing
with buckets for drowning., Now he lays spikes on the roof,
as if to barricade even the sky."

Blood in multiple sheets
Corrodes the centre of our peace
As we walk at ease
While the devil in our mist
Moves with an urban twist in his feet.
His body exalts sepulchral heat.
His breath rigs the stench of rotting carcasses.
His face is a mask that canvases
The abstract images
Of those butchered over the years.
The badge of honour he wears
bears  the horrors and tears of the masses.
Dark clouds hang over the earth when he passes
Vying for souls of innocent lads and lasses
And in men he stands, with fearless calm,
A symbol of what the human race has become., It is the fall of the rising sun
As you and I succumb
To the weaker men that we have become
People of the sun
How come we have become
what we have become, We men have become
fulfillers of apocalyptic prophecies.
While our tongues proclaim victory
Over those buried in unmarked cemeteries
Our skulls remain
Marked by the curse of Cane
Because the blood we have spilled, is the same
As the one that flows in our veins.
Hatred holds us in chains
Now we wave
Pangas in our brother√≠s faces.
√¨I want blood,√Æ it urges.
For the money and power you worship
You hand it over in your brother√≠s skull for a chalice.
While you struggle to sleep in your palace
The mother you have forsaken
Stands shaken by the sight of her sons
who move one with the mark of can.
Hands blood stained: mother pained
as a sibling dies.
A lover cries.
The wind sighs
As the blood in your eyes
Identifies me as you next victim
Yet the blood in your veins identifies me
as your next of kin.
And the hatred within
Exposes you for the weaker man
that we men have become., It is the fall of the rising sun
As you and I succumb
To the weaker men that we have become
People of the sun
How come we have become
what we have become, Where is the power
In spilling the blood of the other
The skulls you gather
Are not trophies of victory
but emblems of lost humanity
the death of we
decay of society
at the hands of our own callousness
what happened to the love and togetherness
the kindness and ones
harness the beauty of the otherness
embrace the essence of life
revive the unified force of positivity
because together as one
we were better than what we men have become"

Michael Minase was born in 1988 Addis Ababa after pursuing his higher education diploma in Information Technology. During his high school days Michael was active member of student art clubs and this helped him to start his theatrical study while presenting his poems at different events.,Ethiopia,"What if everything in the universe was God's poetry? What if all of our lives were words in God's stanzas? In this poem the poet expresses his faith in the order and harmony of creation brought to life through the poetry God has written.  The poet is suggesting that perhaps we should not question what has already been written, but rather we should go with the rhythm and rhyme we born into. The poet uses beautiful language, creative metaphors and calculated delivery to make his case."

HE IS CURRENTLY WORKING AS ADMINSTRATION AND FINANCE HEAD IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AT ADDIS. ",Ethiopia,"The poem appears to be a debate between the haves and have not's. An older man who is well off seems to be disgusted at a younger man who is poor. The old man insists that the younger continues to be poor because of his laziness and recklessness, the younger is blaming the wealthy for his state because although they control the majority of wealth and have left the youth to scramble. The poet fuses contemporary metaphors and similes with very strong local proverbs to capture the argument between two stubborn people who will not see the other's perspective."

She enjoys writing and listening to poetry. One of her poems was published in Sakaza Mngani (A Kidz Community Radio Handbook) in 2007.,DRC,"With clinched fists,
wrenched dreams
and clipped wings,
She attempts to fly.
Perhaps like Icarus, not knowing the fine line between foolishness and bravery.
She carries her load.
In bondage
and caged by her own body.
Trying to find the immense
essence
of ones being.
With the elusive definition
Of her devotion
found in a creed.
Encrypted in her core.
Rooted and concealed,
but often decrypted, when crippled by life.
When evicted by pain,
ensnared by depression,
illusions,
inhibitions
and imperfections.
She endures with silent melodies
ghostly smiles
and with complete bravery,
she tackled life."

Without this document one's life can prove to be difficult. Biblically, if one does not bow before the Lord .òuMazisi' he is destined to Hell and eternal death. Therefore, the poet urges people that they should delight over the world's resources, but they should not forget about everlasting life. That is to serve the living God."

Amen, I still alive.
Belmont didn't take my life last night.
I jump up twice out my sleep.
Thought a man was in my house.
Because where I from we don't sleep easy.
In the house is just granny and me and,
she always afraid somebody go steal she tings.¶
But is really she life she fraid for.
Go back in your bed sun, the sun aint start rising.¶God, granny i writing!
Son is half past one.
No granny is 4am, can't you smell d blood?
Can't you hear that one persistent dog that has been barking since yesterday?
The bitch jus happy to be alive this morning.
Instead of barking I praying because I understand exactly what that dog feeling.
Demons prowling.
Cocaine itching under the skin.
So they sinning to sniff other people sweat and tears away.
Cocaine has no friends.
Especially in Belmont when is 4am,
and  is almost like i could hear the scrape of a spoon at the bottom of an empty condense milk tin as mothers in the valley road try to make miracles  before the babies wake up.
Is the second day of school and the lunch kit new but it have nothing to put in it.
And the school book fresh off the shelf but they afraid to even look in it.
The ghetto afraid to have her heart broken by assumptions she made before.
Too many over educated cocaine dealers under street lamps.
Our futures are not secure tomorrow is not promised to beasts or men.
Especially in Belmont when is 4am.
Roosters screaming their lungs out trying to call up the sun up but like he an all wouldn't listen.
And it will take more than the blaring of cocks to wake my people up.
There are nineteen locks on my house not counting the bolts on the windows.
Because in those few hours before sunrise gunshots usher souls away, from the realm of men.¶I want you to understand me brother is 4a.¶m.
So, buy a dream from a coke head and stitch it on to the fabric of your being to begin to understand the meaning of the mayhem.
And pray for your life forever and ever amen, in Belmont when it's 4am."

Mullato radiance covered my melanin sphere
casting shadows on our segregated thoughts
Reflecting on glazy blue eyes
covered by black hair
Black hair maybe brown
am not really sure
Almost Similar to the color of her intentions
fiercely piercing through my dimly lit room
projecting uncertainty in stuttered speech
So
she spoke mur murmured an index of thoughts
Too complicated to decipher
Mulatto radiance  (Repeat 8 times)
So she spoke murmured an index of thoughts
too complicated to decipher
Like crickets chirping
Like moans breaking in through dark light
Awkwardly in shyness we approach each other
Making mutual contacts
Erotic compass
Her bearing will loose you
courtesy of her Exotic rythm
Writhing like a serpent on silky covers shamelessly
yet honestly exposing our quests
For hear now the truth has spoken
In a language only defined to our ears as music
For hear now the truth has spoken
In a language only defined to our ears as music
Mulatto radiance  (Repeat  8 times)
For hear now the truth has spoken
In a language only defined to our ears as music
In a demeanour that equalizes stereotypes
to the same beat per minute
Based on the principle that our hearts beat
On the same beat per minute
Allow me to define this moment
Her radiance filled me with awe
Like a cat's eyes in pitch black
Glowing so definitely ghostly
Such a complicated dichotomy
Sour milk ferments mahogany
If only I could explain
This radiance that
covers my melanin
If i could only explain
Mulatto radiance"

Real tears poured down its sides
collected in the gutters,
and ran down Banket Street,
and when
the other buildings saw the tower's sadness
they started to weep in sympathy.
Soon the whole city was sobbing,
the tears joined other tears
and filled the depressions and valleys.
They covered the koppies,
and collected in City Deep,
cascading over Gold Reef City
flooding Fordsburg
and soaking Soweto.
They flowed until they became a river
that carried us into the night,
where our dreams grew
taller than buildings
taller than buildings"

When I read me out loud
While the book open to read was you, I did you wrong
When I said you were strong
In a manner that left you feeling weak, I did you wrong
When I spoke at the top of my voice
And built a barrier to your beautiful words, I did you wrong
When I extended my hand to lift you up
When what you really needed was to sit right down and rest, I did you wrong
When I finished your sentences
Taking away your only right to be who you are in my presence, I did you wrong
When I cracked a joke to stop your tears
When grief was truly your soul's need at that time, I did you wrong
When I over-injected your dreams with my passion
And thus took them away from you and made them mine, I did you wrong
When I looked through who you are
To worship whom you could be, I did you wrong
Because I did not love you right
While I blamed you saying you loved me wrong, I did you wrong
Because I could have taken so much less from you
But I took so much more, I did you wrong
But I hurt me more because you hate me now
And I could have made you love me, I did you wrong
Because in hurting me so
I must have given you more hurt than pain can give, I did you wrong
It is as clear to me as lightning in a thundering night sky
I did you wrong
I know it now and it takes away my desire to wake up and reach out to kiss the sky, I did you wrong
Because I allowed a little smoke
To stop us from making a bonfire of love to block the winter winds, I did you wrong
Because I was in such a hurry to watch you grow
I never left you alone to dictate a pace of your own, I did you wrong
Because I loved you with so much heat
I burnt your space to love me back, I did you wrong
Because I loved you so much
I could not be secure enough to trust you with my eyes closed, I did you wrong
Because I said I would take you away to lover's land
But look, I took out the map to hell and played navigator, I did you wrong my love
Because I could love you right, now
But your love is gone and I am here, alone, clutching at phantoms in the dark"

My home is in ruins
every brick I laid
has crumbled to the earth
from which it was baked., Guns are spitting,
bombs raining down
onto temples of worship,
onto my home,
my war torn home., Blood is flowing
from shambles I called home,
pools I once drank from,
places where I found joy!, I'm tired of rebuilding,
tired of cleaning,
burying my people
in my home,
my Palestine., WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING
I've been abused
yet I'm accused
of infecting a nation.
Here I sit
without affection:
weeping, grieving,
not for death
or lives lost
but friends and family
to whom I'm dead.
I'm a worker of the streets
standing in the shadows
selling affection.
Here, I stand,
to survive.
Why the disgust then?
Why look at me so?
Is it because I attach a price
to the services I give?
Or because I let the world know
that this is what I do
rather than disguise it
as a loose life?
Why the faces?
Why the murmurs?
Why?
When this is what you do
when nobody is watching."
"Musa Okwonga is an Oxford University graduate who since then has practised both law and football, with the emphasis on the latter. He won the Junior Bridport Prize for fiction in 1994, for poetry in 1995, and the WH Smith Young Writers competition a year later. He lives in South London.Okwonga considers himself a poet, a sportswriter, a PR professional, an author, and an occasional MC. Okwonga's poetry, which he often writes on London buses, travelling entire routes in order to be immersed in humanity, displays astonishing subtlety of observation. .úThe language has to be a vehicle for the story, the message,.ù Okwonga says. .úOtherwise, it's just intellectual showboating. People go to poetry gigs to hear intellectual honesty..ù In his poetry, as in his life, that is exactly what they get. Okwonga is also a founding member of Poetry collective .úA poem in between people.ù (PIP).",United Kingdom,"My eyes open slowly .ì
As I lie there, I see by my bedside each friend who knows me closely;
So it's come to this. I'm aged halfway to eighty,
And through each year my heart's loved bravely, therefore unsafely;
I've .òfaced fate down, led it a graceful dance,
As it's chased me, I've raced it hard, outpaced it till the last .ì
Till I'm aching,
Till the pain's invaded so many places,
I've had to stop accelerating., I used to be so arrogant;
I thought I'd win life's marathon,
But apparently there are no prizes for pride, or ribbons for diligence;
In the end, there's just the end, which I naively didn't see;
I thought I'd easily persevere,
I thought they'd never send the hearse through here;
You see, I've experienced so much,
I've paid so many dues,
That I thought this was a game I'd never lose;
I started thinking I was immortal
But the second I thought that, God chortled., They say God laughs when we make plans:
He's watched me trace my path away from war-scarred foreign lands,
Where AIDS cases and unmarked graves are common as grains of desert sand,
Where solemn bargains for slaves are made each day by neighbouring clans;
Where I grew up. Soon as I left the womb, I was running;
There was always something to escape, be it Ebola
Or just that drunkard driving that Range Rover,
Racing over potholes, ten shots from being sober.¶
That was me; ever escaping,
Hoping, praying and close-shaving,
Evading nature's worst and Mankind at its most perverse;
No helping hand to rescue me,
I was the perfect refugee .ì
See, Ive been arrested, beaten,
Seized by police for no reason,
Always fleeing by my teeth's skin,
Till leaving,
Coming to Heathrow,
And finding work, and peace, and love
With running no longer in my blood.¶, Now God's given me this tumour,
Spreading through me at the speed of a sleazy rumour;
I've no anger at this cancer:
Thanks to it, I'm resting,
So I guess, though it's disguised, it's a blessing.¶
I look around me; my whole family's here,
My wife, standing here, my son, so handsome here,
And my best man; so how can I feel abandoned here?.¶, I'm walking towards the finish,
Glad I've had a chance to win this prize of such a fine final scene:
A smiling trio of the finest human beings there's ever been.
Nearing the end I think I hear a drumroll, and applause
The sound of a thousand angels stamping the floorboards?.¶, Of course, I could be wrong;
But I cross the line
To find sunlight beyond."
"Mutombo Da Poet, a spoken word artist, emerged on the burgeoning alternative scene in 2006. This Ghanaian has since earned his stripes as an insightful, humorous and captivating performer across the nation. His new spoken word album is called Photosenteces.",Ghana,"Man never knows what tomorrow brings because its opaque,
but the brain can always cut through the transparent past and tap those nostalgic memories to wake.
Imagery of childhood renovates brain so it looks like a gallery,
portraits and abstract but one mosaic depicts the crucifixion on calvary.
This is when he really died because everything was bliss,
an eye for an eye was then an eye for a kiss.
This is in remembrance of childhood like its dead and gone but this past still lives on,
like greats whose works and name have been caligraphed on life's papyrus.
We children who were vagrants like my pappy was,
the only difference was that we had better dreams because we came home to sleep the night away.
Fly away kites made of paper and broomsticks with strong threads to give them skyscraper heights with floors of about ninety six,
experts in building these flying creatures so when it broke we could always fix.
The dreams we had then for today were that tall,
midget physique, so when we looked up, we went dizzy and we did fall.
Parents with whips were like robots, they swung it with an even interval,
so we all had cain stripes like zebras in the wild.
The rod was never spared if things were not done properly,
but stones and caution were thrown to the wind because we were God's property.
police and thief was a brand new hide and seek,
and because each group wanted to win we adopted a war-like technique.
Dummy weapons were aimed opponent with an accuracy
because our elbows had grease but none of my peers were Greeks.
Life if those days was a portrait we all had smiles like Mona Lisa,
I was a local kid so I knew what was kontomire and pona didn't know what was pizza.
Fanta and Coke were not common to us, they only came through on special occasions,
easter and Christmas conjured more eggs so there was a celebration., HOOK
Life in those days was bliss
All those memories that I still do miss.¶.¶.4X, Rains that the clouds puked dropped on the soft earth with dignity,
we enjoyed games in the mud because there was key soap and elders
greeted each other, you could feel the serenity.
The football we played needed no stadiums like the Bundesliga,
we were both players and referees back then we didn't know what was FIFA.
Presence of a socks ball or case 5 made the moment just right to play small poles or 4 corners,
It was with our barefeet because we had no trainers.
Shins were hardened like craniums,
and we worked ourselves up during the day so at night we slept like we had several pills of Valium.
Nana Osei was daddy and Abena Serwaa was mummy in playhouse,
and the game for miniature parents then was, you remove my shirt and I take off your blouse.
My street is dead now, way back it was filled with hawkers,
every junction was occupied by noisy petty sellers
and if I knew this type of horn then, I would have called them vuvuzelas.
I used to catch tadpoles in big gutters
and trapped grasshoppers in poki rubbers because at home it was just a dog
so I wasn't content.
You should see how my mom hopped back when she checked the content.
The alikoto that we played had more spin than the potters wheel,
we went on top of hills so our tyres could glide and those sticks were our steering wheel.
If I can meet the past once again in my future once again I'll beg her to take me back into time,
so I can knock my friends on their heads when they forget to say no zanzama,
play chaskele or dicos with Mick and Mahama and mock 6 year olds when they lose a tooth.
Memories that I never want to forget and I will do it over and over and over again with no regrets., HOOK
Life in those days was bliss
All those memories that I still do miss.¶.¶.4X"

Valley Park greets the rising sun
It could be the heartbeat of the universe
Multi-colored swings, ball courts
bicycle paths, and an outdoor pool
Valley Park comes alive
called a groove
A groove
To the sound of the trucks making deliveries
And the streets that come alive in the morning
My landscape
This is my world of the rising sun
The sound, the sound, the sound
Of a Valley Park morning
It's called a groove
A groove
Or is it just plain old background noise?
When you live in a circle
All things repeat themselves
There is still variation
And contradiction
In it's uniformity
This contradiction within uniformity .ì
It's called a groove
A groove
Valley Park is alive
My first breath came after I entered the light
Each time I enter a new light, I breathe for the first time
My heart-beat came long before I could see
I had life before I could live
When a child is born
The elders will say
That an ancestor has returned
And the sun shall rise
Over Valley Park
It's called a groove
A groove
My connection to the earth is like no other
But all life can spring from the earth
And be sustained by her bounty
But that is only half of what makes you who you are
Look for the rest in the spirits of the skies
Over Valley Park
It's called a groove
A groove
When everything is moving .ì
it gives the illusion that everything is standing still
beauty evolves from the mistakes that we make
trying to repeat our past perfections
and this contradiction
is what we call a groove

little is left

without a name., II, men and women with money lower your proud flags

you will not rest
because of your stealthy height
you cannot leave us alone as fallen heroes and comrades
to distribute the naive history of your combatants, country that was born at the end of the battle like the evening
but your corpses were never buried
soon the earth will be littered with thrifty soldiers
and the nostalgic sounds of unhappy children, the fresh morning will go with its summer
and the old people will follow in their line
and soon there'll be no afternoon, soon the belly of the children will conceive theatrical sobs

receive the immortal wounds of the warriors
the revolution will begin
and the fathers and teachers
follow like funerals in the wake., III, new country

in the ways of our enemies

To become new beings, End this competition and jealousy
to Share more
End this isolation and emptiness
and Hold each other more
End this fear and shame
and Speak the truth more
End this need for power and control
to Listen more
End this killing of our bodies and spirits and each other

Build together
Dream together, More than anything, I want us

the dust of our bones
is meant to form new galaxies

I am Antigen cuz that's where my forefathers were sent
Slave ships ride tyrant waves and seas,
And African American Grandma X is raped by an Irish gent.
First breath taken in the city of Manhattan,
But again we break the pattern and head south,
Where the mouth of my South African root is fed.
Bread all the way between Mmabatho and Cape Town,
In a house where celebrating Eid and Christmas facilitated common ground,
As we throw stones to consult our Ancestors through ritualistic sacrifices,
Sipping on holy red wine in the middle of Ramadan,
Believe it or not makes me one.
One with the sounds of father's saxophone horn,
One with my mother's nest where my soul was formed,
Born into a brewing pot of diversity,
I claim all of me and the beauty of my humanity.
The confliction does not come from the contradiction,
But rather the restriction of the box you constantly want to put me in.
Judging me because you think I form part of a black elite
Which is actually not about me, but a critique on transformed social structures,
But would it matter if I where white?
Questioning my black because there is a lack of African dialect
So you make excuses .òcause I'm light.
Praising me on my well spoken English cuz I'm not like the others
But what are you saying about my fellow brothers.
 Ahoi sista!!! Let's get Irie high!!
Not considering the convenience of not having to relax, perm, braid, blow or die!
There's no profound statement in these locks that consume my head, I just couldn't be bothered to wear a doek every time I go to bed.
I'm drowning in the stigmas attached to being a strong black woman
And I'm tired you see.¶
The acknowledgement of my emotional state takes last priority,
Overlooking that my identity encapsulates immense insecurity,
And that strength is not mutually exclusive of overflowing rushes of vulnerability.
I need someone to cradle me,
I need someone to invest in me,
I need someone to embrace my vulnerability and not run away from me.
I need someone to catch my tears, confront my fears,
I've needed someone for years,
I need someone to engage my being,
Nurture the pain that I too am feeling,
Look through my eyes and listen to my silent cries
The confliction does not come from the contradiction,
But rather the restriction of the box you constantly want to put me in.
I rise I fall,
I have it in the palm of my hand and I lose it all.
A solid grip on reality for that moment remains eternally firm,
Then wrenched from my perfect dream and my world turns,
So I drink my sorrows to numb the pain,
Strip Naked and walk that lonely path praying to be soothed by cleansing rains,
And finally I'm breaking free!!!
Unlocking these chains that suffocate me
Music facilitates my poetry,
Releasing the realms that exist internally,
Creating the space I foresee as guaranteed possibility,
Because the truth is I just want you to relate to me,
Allowing us to engage our differences on a platform of similarity, simultaneously.
The point is I thank you.
I thank you for the confliction, I thank you for the contradiction, I thank you for the restriction of this box you constantly put me in.
You've paved a clearing,
Guided this life-long maze, providing me with certainty
That standing on this stage I embark on a journey to discover the whole African me"

Naledi won the Slam Poetry Competition at University of Cape Town in 2012 and in 2013 she won the national DFL Lover + Another Poetry Challenge in 2013.",South Africa,"My first love is a woman and if you were wondering, I am one too.
I know you would probably never understand
But there's something so real to me about waking up
To the sound of a heartbeat under breasts than any other chest.
There's something so special
About knowing that she loves me more than any man has ever tried to
And I find so much pleasure in the certainty that she knows exactly what I need.
Forgive me but I think I may struggle with this poem
Because I can already feel eyes judging me
And girls wondering if I was checking them out when I was just greeting them
But I'm going to carry on., I probably should have mentioned this a while ago
But I don't think telling you I'm in love with a woman would have been an appropriate response when you asked me to pass the salt,
I don't think any explanation or justification could make this any easier because today since I choose to not have dick in me,
I am reclassified less of a woman and because I kiss girls,
I become a target for men with overwhelming insecurities
And right now this poem will be used against me as my admission of guilt to those waiting to crucify my soul because of my sexuality, so you tell me, at which point did I put myself on the cross?
Was it when I held her hand for the first time in public
And found eternity between our palms
Or was it when we came for the first time at the same time
Under sheets we knew were probably judging us along with the curtains that we were using to hide our sins.
Was it the first time she had her tongue in me
And right there I knew she spoke only the truth because I came,
I came to realize that it was love and it still is
And it will always be true., And the truth is with this poem,
I write for every person who has ever lost their life because of who they chose to be.
I speak for the women who were robbed their vaginas crowns by men who felt the need to terrorize the treasure between their legs,
To find pleasure in their pain,
Power in their screams
And pride after their victory dances over their puddles of tears.
I also write for those who kill,
They say .úForgive them father, for they do not know what they doing.ù
But I'm sorry God please forgive me but I say .úFuck it, they know exactly what they doing..ù
They killing innocent people because once again their uncircumcised egos have been bruised
And .úezizitabane are threats to society.ù,
They are raping other human beings
Because they .údifferent and abnormal and disgusting.ù,
They discriminating against their own flesh and blood
Because apparently God never wanted us to live like this.
But if you have never met God,
Then how would you know what the right way to live is?
So let me ask you something.¶
What if the wheels were turned and being heterosexual was a crime
And you could be punished for holding a man's hand as a girl
And if breaking your virginity with the opposite sex was illegal,
What then?
Would things still be the same?, I think we lost the gist of our struggle a long time ago,
I don't understand how loving someone became a felony,
I don't ever think I will able to fathom how being happy became an offense to people you don't even know.
So,
To whom it may concern,
My first love is a woman and if you still wondering, I am one too.
Yours sincerely,
Me."

Covet my luck when the wild waters' rages wail my name in endless tides
Cry out in sorrow for I am free!, Free!, For I alone can be three persons

Drink with relish.¶and be free! I dip my calabash to the gods of creation!

Those windows.¶those delicate windows that threaten to break.¶, They break, I put each sweet shard to my lips to kiss away their pain
And hug them to my chest
The shattered pieces of glass pierce my breast in eternal gratitude, I am a child of twisted conscience
The seed of disappointment in the copulation of body and soul
I can no longer feel nor recognize nor bond
I am a cold, massless phantom that can seduce your spirits to iniquity, Don't.¶forgive me.¶, Watch me fade away into emptiness

Receiving praises from a politician
Who only eats beef imported, From Argentina, while the people
Queue for water., God does everything, everywhere.
Floods stream when her bladder
Can no longer contain the screams from the earth;
Blessing the hungry with
A cedi at the edge of a gutter, At Nima.î
And after gaining no pleasure
From the monotonous lives of humans,, She sets a new comic in motion:
Wives catching cheating husbands,
The blind falling in gutters,
Fools winning lotteries., At the peak of her pleasure's end,, God laughs thunders, hurricanes, earthquakes;
And shifts the tectonic plates
While quoting Laing:
.òAnd what was joy anyway,
But a movement of brain energy.'"

",South Africa,"Damn! She reminds me of a girl who's feet stayed clued to feet on pavement
She would sketch butterflies during the day
Then at night, they would all die out
Then her nightmare begins, the demons inside her closet start to sing
Misty horizons shatter her earthly eyes
A story that can only be told by the bruises on her thighs, During the day, Dorothy would thrive and ride on the wings of fairies
Then at night, Dorothy muffled silent screams whilst chasing vigilante dreams
She felt like the Gods had forsaken her
As she mothered children she could not bear
Grown men with childhood issues too ugly to be expressed with a snare
Some say she looked in to the moon way too long
She was blinded by the glare, Now she bents forward to pick up a wishlist of psychedelics
That was only swept away by her divine breath
Then she released that her heartbeat was a crescendo of songs
A crescendo of songs that have never been sung in this dimension
Dorothy found broken feet in between the rhythm of the funk
Now, as her heart pumps, the crowd jumps
Dorothy now knows that every time she smiles
For a split second, Christ comes, A hug from Dorothy took me back to a dream
In which Medusa kissed me on the forehead
With lips as soft as the lullabys she sings to Gods
Dorothy took me back to my lonely nights of hip-hop
Teleporting through space and time with a head-nod
Fish whispering in my left ear, telling me to stop acting what I am not, But damn homie!! These are just whispers of a dream
Inscribed upon my tongue by the kiss of a queen"

and take a ride to any universe
be the beauty of soul sound and energy
create my child like you the created
earn the language of moulding
seeds into fruitful beings.
I'm raising you so you too can raise me
infant of my skin
reveal chapters the two of us
are yet to learn
and believe me child
some of the rules i
have run into can save your soul.
So listen up child,
so clothe yourself with ancient souls
who knew before we did that you,
the future
will be born into this crazy but jazzy
scene called living.
Rise and let the world know you are here
to claim no sense
nor sin but only the waking and dream
dripping sun of each dawn.
Never wait for time's breath to blow
into your lungs rather bloom
from the dust we rose from like mystics
to grow your own wings
and be sure to ask for strength between
these wings
so they don't split into pieces cause
child, I'm raising you to be whole.
Listen close child cause you're a sister,
and I'm a sister
remove your walk from exhausting., Arms of men-talities who can't
take a strong sister and
white supremacies who want to think
we're strong enough only
for taking their instructions
and child, I'm stung but the swelling truth
I'm learning
that not every woman is a sister.
So, listen up gal
listen up, bloom of my belly
infant of my skin never step into boxes
these aren't enough to hold our stories alive
rise to the knowledge that our people
and theirs are tapestries
sown long and wide enough to hold you up
till you can uphold yourself
never forbid your truth in spaces that
strangle your realities
rise child your vision is our voice
walk to the knowledge that you are
everything that is musical.¶."

Be of burial and hatred
And stanzas of violence
Until love is an empty gong?, For how long will this go on?
For how long must our song
Be devoid of love and laughter and joy
And those little things we've forgot?"

I know in my thoughts
As though my absence for over a decade
Has meant nothing
As though the characters that populate my memories
Are as I left them
Although many are long gone, The city of now is no longer as was
The present has left little to imagine of its past
Whole neighborhoods created and destroyed
Homes, his/her stories crumble with bulldozers
Giving rise to high rises, Our meetings, though frequent, are fleeting
I am yet to acquaint myself with what you've become
To relearn who you were
And who I was with you, I fear feeling unhome at home
Of feeling more comfort in places that are not, Is it possible to be outside one's own world?
Or perhaps it was never mine to claim?
Perhaps notions of home and world wax and wane and take on meanings of their own?, New flower, I wonder if I will grow old with you.¶or if you will age with me"

On the faith that
The good will come and
The toxic release of traitors will run
Like thieves from territories destined
For greatness
Saving virgins from knives
Erected beauty
Slashing at the real war
The core of male identity
My masculine side strikes back
Whipping fights to feel
With the right to dance, rejoice and deal
With the heat of
My will to survive
Mutilated in body but not in mind, Because I am a girl, Without a place for peace
Without silver for pleasure
He burned
My face
My legs
My back
My treasure
For dowries greater than
The hellish skin
I grew out of when charred memories colored my lips
Like apartheid's cancer
With head wraps for cover
Because I am pretty on the inside"

Ngasuma Kanyeka is a poet based in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. ,Tanzania,"Dear fingers,
 I love the way you linger,
on places that should be untouched,
 on spaces that should be left alone,
listen I know that you burn,
 and through that I learn,
that the power of your touch, could light another lantern ,
 I love that you can touch my core with a stroke,
 I love the sensation only you can evoke,
 but I want to let you know that you are not the only sense  that is, entitled to discovery,
that as much as I love you, I love my eyes too,
see I love my eyes because they see the colours and hues ,
 I love seeing seasons renewed,
the changes in places but mostly in people's faces,
 the cracking of ones' skin, the saggy parts of what was once lean,
 like the depth of caves and the width of waves,
I love what you give me in wonder,
I cannot appreciate you enough for letting me discover the shape of my fingers,
but dear eyes as much as I love you, I must tell you who I love the most,
See I love my sixth sense, the one that speaks to my body with overwhelming power ,
 hitting my belly with pangs when there are unseen fangs on the prowl,
See I love my spirit for letting me see the colours and visions in the darkness that I would not have seen in the light,
for letting me see the stories that I would tell, the unforeseen happening that I already see so well.
 I love this holiest of places, that I cherish with prayers, that strips bare all my layers,
 that tells me to heed silence especially when its loud, because in that golden crowd of confusion that is where truth is found,
I love my stubborn streak, that tells me listening to my instinct is meek,
because where is the structure and method in visions?
but this great invention churns out harsh lessons , that each time I defy my conscious,
I defy my most vivid self, I discover a lesson and in this painful moment,
 I am touched by a blessing and see the truth in discovery and divine."

We light our candles in chapels during night vigils.
Today still, they call it an act.
Feathers that flock to find freedom.
Our faint hearts, and faith
Their politics and laws
By laws
My in laws
Ancestral beliefs.
Maybe acts of matrimony, motherhood, mistakes and memories
Matriarchies and morning glories, Riddles and rhymes to tickle your mind
Fiddle with time, it's a fickle design.

Sabbaticals from society
Sobriety.
Seasonal harvesting of the crops.

Tied in promises of forget me (k)nots.

Antidotes and tight ropes
Insecurity, security and secularity
Experiences that we shelled in embryos
Fertilization and fetuses
Failures and forgiveness
Retirement, reflections and revolution stories

Misunderstood and ruined by the world, Our panties are still purple
She loves lavender, not lotus or lilies but lavender
I now love lavender too, so I water the garden while she picks the fruit

Its lifeless eyes looking at nothingness,
Its hand soft like a child's
Yet with folds and veins
That bear witness to life at its last., I have heard death speak,
Its shrill, quiet voice
Seems to lose its thought.
The words crying out yet,
Still carrying hope
Like a drop of water
Seeking survival in a desert
Saying
I am alright,
Do not cry for me,
I am alright
I see the peace I will feel., I have felt death around me,
Next to me,
Staring back at me,
Talking to me,
I have felt its cold
Yet warm presence lingering
Like a sweet aroma
Pulling her
Njeri wa Gikaru
Cucu, my grandmother, I sat there
A warm wet feeling on my cheeks
As death's eyes stared back at me
With the same hollowness."

",South Africa,"We betrayed our kin
when we burnt
(alive)
our brother
because he was birthed on foreign soil.
We betrayed our skin
when a man's charred remains
became our own
because we refused him in his wholeness.
His hair was too peppercorn,
his skin too charcoal,
his Africa too North
for our acceptance
so he died on the street,
engulfed in the flames of our rejection., The next day,
we bowed our heads in shame
when the journalists came.
We shattered our mirrors
(we deserved the bad luck)
but the river redrew our faces.
We became monsters overnight.
Caricatures of ourselves at our worst
became us., The last man who left me asked,
.úWhy am I so choked by goodbye?.ù
I tore away from him and wept.
In Africa it is better to say goodbye
(even if you choke)
than to stay and watch your flesh burn,
stay and see your skin fall off and leave behind
the bones of your forefathers."

This poem is a beautiful portrait of our beloved Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela. The poet's love and respect for this internationally celebrated hero is evident; she describes him as a king, a deliverer, God sent, a cow that feeds the whole nation. The poet prays that Nelson's soul is at rest after all his sacrifices and his hard work. Her tone is personal and intimate."
"Nompendulo Shabangu, a.k.a. Nomps, recalls writing poems for her mother for Mothers' Day from the time that she was in primary school. She has been blessed with phenomenal English teachers all the way from pre-school. Nomps is a writer of short stories, poetry, and she also has her own blog.Nomps is a Motswana, yet she was raised in South Africa. All of her works are inspired by God. Her writings are about God, love, and justice; three topics that are inseparable. She believes that through her writings, poems, and performances, she gets to be an advocate, a voice for the voiceless and to also offer up hope to the hopeless. She aims to raise awareness about the social ills and current affairs, and in turn mobilize her audience to proaction. She also aims to spread love, and to help instill purpose.Nomps is a member of Poetavango Spoken Word poetry, and she performs at their events. She has performed at the 2014 Maun International Arts Festival, and the Barona Gratitude Gala in Maun in May 2015. Even though Nomps performs in English, she also writes Zulu and Xhosa pieces.",Botswana,"One of my most favorite things was when my mother would cup my face in her warm hands
And smile so bright with glistening eyes
and tell me hwo she loves my big brown eyes
I loved how she combed my hair so gently
And whisper to me so faintly
How she couldn ºt imagine life without me
And that there was nowhere else she would rather be
Mom told me that my Dad threatened to leave
Her if she didn ºt get rid of me
And even though she loved him and didn ºt want to lose him She decided that whatever will be, will be
I often have flashbacks of how Mom and I used to struggle I remember that the only blanket I had at times
was my mother ºs warm body pressed close to mine
And when she would hear my soft sobs that I tried to hide She ºd whisper to me, .úHoney, we ºll be just fine.ù
And just fine we became
Because truthfully, situations don ºt remain forever the same Guess what, a child doesn ºt remain a child forever
Ha! I grew up and I worked hard.
I became top of my university class
I refused to let my background hold me back
I graduated and became a lawyer
And I ºll never exchange the proud look on my mother ºs face
She cried and tried to hide the tears
She couldn ºt believe that we ºd overcome our fears Looking back to all those years
That ºs what could have been
It hurt to know that these big bright eyes
would never live to see their own mother ºs eyes
And that these ears would never hear that .úwe ºll do just fine.ù
Because somehow they got to her
The people that managed to convince her that I was just a blob of cells Tissue. That ºs what they said.
I wish the other people had gotten to her first
They could have informed her that my Maker said that
Even before I was in her womb He knew me
And that He equipped me to be a blessing
While He was knitting me in her womb
But that womb in which I was supposed to be secure
Ended up being my tomb
And even though I wasn ºt fully developed
I felt it as I was torn from limb to limb
How dare they convince her that I ºm just a bunch of cells
Many have sown seeds and expected something to grow out of it,
And it did.
And it did.
But no one ever thought that something would ever grow out of this seed.
They don ºt know that when I was killed in my mother ºs womb My dreams and hopes were also killed with me.
All that I could ever become was killed with me
You see, my mother was wrapped up with what was before her, And she didn ºt stop to think of what could be
Yes, my Daddy would have left But we would have been just fine.
Even though people managed to tell her that I was just a blob of cells What nobody knows is that she secretly mourns
On what would have been my birthday
She recalls how old I would be
And even though she tells people that my sister is her first child Deep down inside she knows it ºs really me"

Our fists defying gravity.

The battle scars
When the war ends,
And the blood of the brave, is now watering flower-beds
Needs us to yield, surrender.¶
We have to quieten down the noise of the drones and tanks
Choose life and breath
Allow the soldiers to rebuild broken homes and bridges burnt
Raise our flags, give peace a try,
Relinquish the rage
concede to our humanity
We cannot all be charging bulls
When we see red.
As behind the flag is man with a sharp object.
The fight is not lost, just paused.

Congo in our cell phones
Congo in our air planes
Congo in our space shuttles
Congo in our computers
Congo in our furnaces
Congo- everywhere and nowhere at the same time
Because Congo is not in our mind, Pulse of the Motherland, They say you can't judge a book by its cover
But it has become appallingly clear
That you can judge an entire continent
By its media coverage, You can color a whole continent dark
With the paint of poorly placed perception
When you rely on the media
To teach you your Africa lessons, Because I come from a continent,
That the world thinks is a country
And to put it bluntly,
We're all HIV positive
Until proven negative
In the eyes of the media, It's like Africa is either one big safari
Or Kalahari with seethin' heathens
With no sense of religion
And home to animals and animism, Because TV renditions of African afflictions
Have created a depiction
Of a land of savages
Where the world's most dreadful diseases
Exceed the law of averages
And since American TV
Only shows the ravages of a select few nations
Most Americans juxtapose the mother of civilization
With phrases like .údamnation.ù and .ústarvation.ù, So if we don't control our own images,
We can't expect to see
A true representation of our beauty, Most non-Africans believe that the most
Africa has given to the world
Are phrases like .úHakuna mtata.ù
And .úAsante sana squash banana.ù
Along with exotic vacations in remote locations
.òCause I've never heard an American TV news station
Even say we're made up of 54 nations, In the eyes of the media,
We're just underdeveloped wannabe Caucasians
Still searching for civilization
If you buy the media's interpretation
Of who we are
But am I taking this too far?, Because to me,
The real problem be the WB, ABC, &amp; NBC
Which are the real WMD:
Weapons of Mind Destruction, Because too many people
Including many Africans
See what they see
Through the smart bombs they call TV
And it's not just the newscasts,
It starts at age 3, Because I grew up
Watching images of Bugs Bunny
Dressed in grass skirts and black face
Speaking in .úAfrican dialects.ù
And every 10 years,
There's a new version of Tarzan on the TV set, And I don't know about y'all,
But I recall seeing gorillas pass for Africans
In those .úTin-Tin.ù cartoons
And if you remove
Marvin Martians' helmet from Looney Tunes
He's probably an African illegal alien
Or a fallen, faithless, famine-stricken African child
With his stomach protruded, And it's these convoluted characterizations
That have helped in creating grown-up policy makers
Who partially base their opinions of our homeland
From films such as .úCongo.ù,
.úGorillas in the Midst.ù and .úThe Air up There.ù
And we can't forget .úTears of the Sun.ù
Which left too many tears on the sons and daughters of Africa,
Searching for a beautiful representation
Of our native land, But that won't happen until we Africans
Take responsibility for our portrayal
Because the betrayal of our friends
From FOX, CBS, and CNN
Means we will never see-an-end
To caricatures of the continent of human creation
Which has been made to look
Like she's on her deathbed
And ready for cremation, But we will show the world
That our Mother Africa is strong, vibrant and defiant
Because the pulse of nearly a billion people can never die
When WE control what the world sees,
So we must never comply
To pictures painted by pessimists on TV of our homeland
For we are the pulse of Africa
And we will now show the world
How proudly we will stand!"

As sisters, not some tools or fools
They have embraced some joke yesters
Those who just put to the taste buds
Then they vanish into the thin air;
Strength of the fat pocket
I wished to stay; divine love
So nothing is perfect, What was good is now bad
Love is now enmity
Friendship- rivalry
Morality altered to immorality
Royalty slaughtered by dynamicity of culture
Slogans interpreted wrongly
Fleshes running away from light
Embracing plight
Nothing s perfect

Thus inspired, he has been performing at community events, spoken word and poetry readings, and concerts since 1998.He is currently the president of Baro Dununba, a Toronto based music ensemble and philanthropic organization. Along with Baro Dununba, he has performed as part of Muhtadi's World Drummers, Quammie Williams' JUMP Collective and the New Dimension Steel Orchestra. Poetic collaborations have included the International Festival of Poetry of Resistance and T Dot Griots anthologies. In 2007 he released his first book entitled, Rebirth of the Warrior Poet. This self-publication afforded him the opportunity to participate in both the 2007 Caribbean Canadian Literary Expo and the Organization of Calypso Performing Artistes' Calypso Tents Music Series as part of Caribana 2007 (aka Toronto Caribbean Carnival).",Canada,"You told me once that I am Black

Maybe I hope too much.

I have been loving him out of habit for so long that I have even forgotten why.
But today it is time to let go.
It is time to stop loving things that are always on the move, like my father.

My father is a shooting star.

"Patricia is an internationallly published, award winning novelist and poet whose works have been translated into five languages.In 1984, in response to apartheid and the political violence in the Eastern Cape, she opened a non-racial pre-school. She wrote and self-published stories, poems and songs that had relevance to her pupils' lives, and which were based on the same principles of peace she used in her classes.After completing a Master's Degree in creative writing at the University of Cape Town, she focused on full-time authorship. Although her novels are decorative, magical, opulent and richly furnished, they carry at core a deep, philosophical note as she exposes the emotional carnage caused by war and genocide.Her novels reflect variously on the Holocaust, South Africa's wars in Angola and Mozambique, Zimbabwe's Chimurenga war and current dictatorship, the bombing of Dresden and apartheid.They also reflect on the way we .òwar' against the earth and other species.Yet, despite these dark matters, her fictions are full of hope and joy and love.Her poetry is another matter. Here she is blunt and to the point. She captures, in language that is at times paradoxically lyrical and beautiful, the full scale and horror of war, genocide, fratricide and our destruction of the natural world.

with eyes that are dark and kind.
I want to know where you sleep and how you eat, and what you do
when you are not here minding cars in Kloof Street
and what you dream about now that war is behind you.
I want to know how you travelled here
whether you have your papers in order or whether, you live as a fugitive and how you are treated
in this democratic South Africa, you
with your finely spoken French and courteous manner.
Your home is a run-down building in run-down Salt River.
As you lead me through behind the stairwell, and out into the backyard I notice washing hanging
and the sour smell of drains.
Your place is a large room shared by many
curtained off for cooking and sitting and sleeping.
They are waiting for us, your friends, and all stand when we enter, without speaking.
You introduce them one by one and I wonder
what part they played in war. I sit on the old sofa
and they sit around on odd chairs, or stand
crowding around me waiting for me to speak, but I cannot, for I am stunned by everything .ì by their faces which I search
by their hands, by the magazine pictures pasted on the walls
by the languages they speak to each other
as one by one they say their names
and where they have fled from:, Congo Angola Congo Angola Congo Angola.
I am here looking at your quarters. You own so little.
What do you think of me, for asking you to show me your life?
What do you think as I drive off out of run-down Salt River
glancing in my mirror at your standing figure, glancing in my mirror at you, you framed by bleak buildings
with a sad woman sitting on a doorstep
and old rain left puddled and painted with oil?
What do you think of me as I drive away
leaving behind only my gift of sweet red plums?"

and I got my own beauty.
It is knife-scrawled across my back in sore, jagged letters,
it's in the way my eyes snap away from the obvious.
I sit in my dim matchbox,
on the edge of a bed tousled with my ragged smell,
slide razors across my hair,
count how many ways
I can bring blood closer to the surface of my skin.
These are the duties of the righteous,
the ways of the anointed.
The face that moves in my mirror is huge and pockmarked,
apple-cheeked, scraped pink and brilliant,
I am filled with my own spit.
Two years ago, a machine that slices leather
sucked in my hand and held it,
whacking off three fingers at the root.
I didn't feel nothing till I looked down
and saw one of them on the floor
next to my boot heel,
and I ain't worked since then.
I sit here and watch niggers take over my TV set,
walking like kings up and down the sidewalks in my head,
walking like their fat black mamas named them freedom.
Well, my shoulders tell me that ain't right.
So I move out into the sun
where my beauty makes them lower their heads,
or into the night
with a lead pipe up my sleeve,
a razor in my boot.
I was born to make things right.
It's easy now to move my big body into shadows,
to move from a place where there was nothing
into the stark circle of a streetlight,
the pipe raised up high over my head.
It's a kick to watch their eyes get big,
round and gleaming like cartoon jungle boys,
right in that second when they know
the pipe's gonna come down, and I got this thing
I like to say, hey, listen to this, I like to say
.úHey, nigger, Abe Lincoln's been dead a long time..ù
I get hard listening to their skin burst.
I was born to make things right.
Then this reporter comes around,
seems I was a little sloppy kicking some fag's ass
and he opens up and screams about it.
This reporter finds me at home in my bed,
TV flashes licking my face clean.
Same ol' shit.
Ain't got no job, the coloreds and spics got 'em.
Why ain't I working? Look at my hand, asshole.
No, I ain't part of no organized group,
I'm just a white boy who loves his race,
fighting for a pure country.
Sometimes it's just me.
Sometimes three.
Sometimes 30.
AIDS will take care of the faggots,
then it's gon' be white on black in the streets.
Then there'll be three million.
I tell him that.
So he writes it up,
and I come off looking like some kind of goddamned freak,
like I'm Hitler himself.
I ain't that lucky,
but I got my own beauty.
It is in my steel-toed boots,
in the hard corners of my shaved head.
I look in the mirror and hold up my mangled hand,
only the baby finger left,
I know it's the wrong goddamned finger,
but fuck you all anyway.
I'm riding the top rung of the perfect race,
my face scraped pink and brilliant.
I'm your baby, America, your boy,
drunk on my own spit, I am goddamned fuckin' beautiful.
And I was born
and raised
right here."
"Paul Laurence Dunbar was the first African-American poet to garner national critical acclaim. Born in <a href=""http://www.dayton.net/dayton/"">Dayton, Ohio, in 1872, Dunbar penned a large body of dialect poems, standard English poems, essays, novels and short stories before he died at the age of 33. His work often addressed the difficulties encountered by members of his race and the efforts of African-Americans to achieve equality in America. He was praised both by the prominent literary critics of his time and his literary contemporaries.Dunbar was born on June 27, 1872, to Matilda and Joshua Dunbar, both natives of Kentucky. His mother was a former slave and his father had escaped from slavery and served in the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and the 5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War. Matilda and Joshua had two children before separating in 1874. Matilda also had two children from a previous marriage.The family was poor, and after Joshua left, Matilda supported her children by working in Dayton as a washerwoman. One of the families she worked for was the family of Orville and Wilbur Wright, with whom her son attended Dayton's Central High School. Though the Dunbar family had little material wealth, Matilda, always a great support to Dunbar as his literary stature grew, taught her children a love of songs and storytelling. Having heard poems read by the family she worked for when she was a slave, Matilda loved poetry and encouraged her children to read. Dunbar was inspired by his mother, and he began reciting and writing poetry as early as age 6.Dunbar was the only African-American in his class at Dayton Central High, and while he often had difficulty finding employment because of his race, he rose to great heights in school. He was a member of the debating society, editor of the school paper and president of the school's literary society. He also wrote for Dayton community newspapers. He worked as an elevator operator in Dayton's Callahan Building until he established himself locally and nationally as a writer. He published an African-American newsletter in Dayton, the Dayton Tattler, with help from the Wright brothers.His first public reading was on his birthday in 1892. A former teacher arranged for him to give the welcoming address to the Western Association of Writers when the organization met in Dayton. James Newton Matthews became a friend of Dunbar's and wrote to an Illinois paper praising Dunbar's work. The letter was reprinted in several papers across the country, and the accolade drew regional attention to Dunbar; James Whitcomb Riley, a poet whose works were written almost entirely in dialect, read Matthew's letter and acquainted himself with Dunbar's work. With literary figures beginning to take notice, Dunbar decided to publish a book of poems. Oak and Ivy, his first collection, was published in 1892.Though his book was received well locally, Dunbar still had to work as an elevator operator to help pay off his debt to his publisher. He sold his book for a dollar to people who rode the elevator. As more people came in contact with his work, however, his reputation spread. In 1893, he was invited to recite at the World's Fair, where he met Frederick Douglass, the renowned abolitionist who rose from slavery to political and literary prominence in America. Douglass called Dunbar .úthe most promising young colored man in America..ùDunbar moved to Toledo, Ohio, in 1895, with help from attorney Charles A. Thatcher and psychiatrist Henry A. Tobey. Both were fans of Dunbar's work, and they arranged for him to recite his poems at local libraries and literary gatherings. Tobey and Thatcher also funded the publication of Dunbar's second book, Majors and Minors.It was Dunbar's second book that propelled him to national fame. William Dean Howells, a novelist and widely respected literary critic who edited Harper's Weekly, praised Dunbar's book in one of his weekly columns and launched Dunbar's name into the most respected literary circles across the country. A New York publishing firm, Dodd Mead and Co., combined Dunbar's first two books and published them as Lyrics of a Lowly Life. The book included an introduction written by Howells. In 1897, Dunbar traveled to England to recite his works on the London literary circuit. His national fame had spilled across the Atlantic.After returning from England, Dunbar married Alice Ruth Moore, a young writer, teacher and proponent of racial and gender equality who had a master's degree from Cornell University. Dunbar took a job at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. He found the work tiresome, however, and it is believed the library's dust contributed to his worsening case of tuberculosis. He worked there for only a year before quitting to write and recite full time.In 1902, Dunbar and his wife separated. Depression stemming from the end of his marriage and declining health drove him to a dependence on alcohol, which further damaged his health. He continued to write, however. He ultimately produced 12 books of poetry, four books of short stories, a play and five novels. His work appeared in Harper's Weekly, the Sunday Evening Post, the Denver Post, Current Literature and a number of other magazines and journals. He traveled to Colorado and visited his half-brother in Chicago before returning to his mother in Dayton in 1904. He died there on Feb. 9, 1906.",United States,".òLIAS! .òLias! Bless de Lawd!

And mouth with myriad subtleties., Why should the world be overwise,
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while, We wear the mask., We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask!"

",South Africa,"Imaged again, she stirs:
My mother, She has sloughed out of me blackly, beautifully,
Slurring each glaring day into the next,
Since her passing, It is early May. I walk up Cavendish Street,
Wearing a jersey although the sun shines.
It is that time of the year that
Reminds you of the intimacy of Time,
Liquid ambers loosing their leaves,
The sun shedding its last brilliance before winter,
Putting me in mind of other times., Times she guarded the stone of her pain so closely,
Forbidding its fall into our common water to ripple.¶
And all the time the brain behind the eyes
that danced with the multiform meanings of autumn
was cannibalising itself., Wintered in, in front of her mirror
She told herself what she had known
From the first diagnosis :
To clothe her remaining days
In the mantle of deliberate miracle,
Its blue penumbra holding us beclamed
Until time, Knowing the end, she said
I had hoped it would not be so soon, Gone, she has gone:
my mother"
"PAULINATION is an outspoken voice that captures people in passing and makes them listen,he speaks of human experience in different categories revolving around issues faced by society like drugs, sexual abuse and racial tension. He incorporates dramatical aspects mixed with energetic movements and wonderful click sounds into his stories, what makes him different is the lyrical mixture that cuts through the barrier between Zulu and English.This outspoken storyteller is originally from a group of poets called Nowadays Poets.",South Africa,"Vasco de gamma arrived in the cape
To find a race not encountered in his eyes.
Was it our fate notice a difference in race or was it
Institutionalized?
Biased minds see these as rhetorical questions, but
I find it logical to say that these questions don't breathe an
answer because this is a nation
where class is factor., Where tradition plays a role in a
Racism that goes with financial complex.
Where others believe white people are still given
Better jobs and blacks have to undergo a lot of
scrutiny.
Where businesses hire an inexperienced white person
Where racial tension is ignored and scholars judge and
are judged for it.
Where the only change is dominance of black where we lack
balance and focus mainly on BEE, Why can't we see that individuality
Is arrested and society has an influence on our minds?, Where the government has an influence on the people.
Where everything goes in twos like
THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA!!
Where others believe its all propaganda and that's
because we pose questions leading to a segregated nation
Where  money has no value where we value the fact that
.úSouth Africa is a nation of extremes so says.ù our ex-president.
Where sex and crime still plays a role
Where we crawl to our vision of this nation bit by bit.
Where black and white shouldn't be used
Where we are fused to remove boundaries of colour and
Offer a different mentality
Where nationality drives us crazy and independence plays
a major factor.
Where political reasoning is enough to justify racial tension
and every problem we have in this nation BUT
MOST OF ALL Where are we today?
Where information still needs to be given to the people
And a lot still needs to be acknowledged and improved coz from Vasco de gamma
I see little difference and for the evidence
Look at the segregation in living locations TOWNSHIPS
Are still dominated by black people where are all the other
races. Suburbs still have a lot of white people where
are all the other faces?
THIS IS JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT for You taken by ten
Different people I interviewed this afternoon."

Each soul's simple existence being the
Sole purpose of breathig in each others wants
And  out each others needs
He was me and I was him
I never knew where he ended and I begun
Bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
 So intertwined and inseparable
We were twisted
Discovery bounced off each of us
He started sentences and I finished them
Reached for the same thing my mind was on
Our hands touching and flirting courting bliss
In every moment
Our thoughts so synchronised a transfixed gaze
 Or gentle glance would communicate
So well across a room of hundreds
Seeing me meant seeing him and so the story went that
 In absentia one represented both
And questions were not asked .¶there was no need
I was him and he was me
Currents of energy resonated and resounded off each of us
 With eyes closed
I could tell he had walked into a room
 So distinct was he that instinct picked him up
Like breathing, when troubled or extremely excited
  He was my default
He was me and I was him
His mind my haven, my soul his retreat
His lap my comfort, my heart his home
We were both guilty of committing the same crime
Head over heels or heels over head in love
It was magic and tragic how no one else seemed to matter for company just us two
Our past time was exploring this God that had created such love
 He had to be amazing because it was heaven
 So a real heaven had to exist somewhere
The existence of such a father was believable because
 A love like this had to be held up
By more than two hearts entwined thus shifting the trajectory of our lives
For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
 And cleave to his wife and the two shall
Become one.¶.¶.flesh
I was him and he was me
Not glued together by lust but genuine affection and attention
Meaning his heart kept perfect pace with mine
In our silence we spoke the same language
Sekabantwana  the father of my children
All He Man
Was strong sometimes just for my sake
Would hold it down so I wouldn't break
He was me and I was him
His personality sweet, words didn't count
To fill the gaps cause we were comfortable
Voids didn't exist or chasms
 Instead we had periods of bonding holding hands
Counting the stars
Crowds were fascinating cause
 They kept us entertained with questions on how we
Could afford such a luxury, some wondered about fairytales and things being a
Thing of the past, so ignorant were they that when it's right you don't try too hard
But you work determinedly hard through each kink and crink
We were classic
He made it easy to be woman
And he grew all man because he had the right woman
He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favour from the Lord
Unkululnkulu had his ways of working miracles
All we knew was that somehow we were privileged
Yes some call it blessed, we were all that and more
Words when he said them were at the right time, Explaining why I married him
I do meant submitting, honouring, respecting and cherishing
This applied to us both no double standards
Being faithful to each other was not a question
Trust was second nature and doubt didn't figure in our cards
Which wasn't only emblematic but iconic
To some this perfect picture meant meeting the man of your dreams
Followed by his beautiful wife ironic
We never tried figuring this out because we had nothing to prove
Enhlizweni zethu siyakwazi we were meant to be
GOD had brought us together
He was me and I was him
Unbelievable yet amazingly clarifying that you could have it all
Then I woke up.¶.¶.."

Undefiled by the stride of the colonial lion
Hunting down the gazelle of my being.

Night; speckled with dots of light

With their light, borne by Moffat and Livingstone,
Sent to rape our identities in missionary position
Then fail to explain what colour the Father is

Jesus of Nazareth, whose holey hands
Have sent more tumbling to the pits of hell
Than they have saved!, Often I say these things and my own people
Get cross and want to crucify me,
They call me sacrilegious 'cause I have the balls
To read the Bible upside-down
And say what it's saying when it's saying
What they are not saying it's saying;
Who's insane?! Why not call me mean, because I mean
What I say and I say what I mean and what I mean is

Of Nehanda and Kaguvi to poison our minds:

And all you other angels turned demons,
All you fools of empty promises,
Yes you ho smile for the camera and frown
As you toast civil servants baking in the sun
For daily bread., You see the African I am is not a Google definition,
But how do I wean my siblings off the nipples
On the internet and make them face books
And realise that they are more than just a Facebook profile?

Her poems draw images of growing up in Uganda in the 60s and 70s and in the later years as an immigrant in various parts of Africa .ì touching on both the personal and political as it impacted her. Having lived in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Namibia and South Africa, she often wrestles with the question of identity and belonging. She also explores her triumphs and struggles as a woman.Namutebi also has a passion for folktales and myths .ì the wisdom of centuries, the tried and tested imagery, the archetypal characters that give new perspective to the perennial questions that we struggle with. She says, .úWhen a story gets my heart beating faster, or an image in a story stirs something inside me, I know that that story has come to teach me at this moment in my life! I believe this is true for everyone..ùNamutebi lives in Cape Town with her husband, Victor, and 3 children .ì Faye, Senteza and Chris.",Uganda,"11 years old

but don't worry, we will be alright.'

And when she returned she said,

Leave widows afraid to greet the sun, and
Children look to the hill to silence echoing bellies
Blood and tears water our land,
Yet these are not enough to quench the mineral thirsty demons., It is better to die this way, than the slow death of being forced
To watch minerals being sucked from the intestines of our father's land,
Or the taste of soot, while stooping in chimneys
Bare hands carving out rock., We have stared death in the face before,
In Aurora, Marikana and every other mine
Acid mine water deprive grinding stones of maize,
Drag us underground to make enough living to keep us underground,
Chiseling out stars we'll never see., Our blood feed obese commissions of enquiry,
Their terms of reference to find another
Quietly to bite out the minerals out of the earth's womb,
Silence the groveling spirits
Police did what they had to do to appease the BBEE mining magnates,
and foreign investment gods., We use words as our shield,
Run to the fully armored death,
With sticks and stones,
Mere fathers."

his half-stoned face popping out from the fish in the fridge

I watch his stumpy fingers delve a keen blade

your bones for their support .ì

hang like grapes in the vineyard of your body;

that make you move so flawlessly, and keep me up at night:

and your face turning away from mine

Balancing history and geography

In street corners

He disturbs my soul:
He leadeth me in the path of insurrection

Yea though I walk through the valleys
And shadows of inflation
I will not fear his evil
Though he is against me
His laws and hallucinations
Infuriate me
He prepareth reduction in my salary
In the presence of my enemies
He anointest my head with batons

Will follow him all the days of his administration
And I will carry my AK 47

Ijala and ewi over the talking drum
Will leave you all craving, begging for more
When hunters battle rapped, Ijala was born

Deep within our hearts there was a longing for God
We felt He was too far Edumare was pawned
For the deities and demons that were baying for blood
Cattle were sacrificed, we were playing along
They weren't satisfied, thy demanded our sons
Art form, transformed by bad blood
Became the platform that fuelled the backdrop
Of the horror and the torture from inter-tribe wars
They sold us as slaves but we went with our song
Padlocked our lips but we still had a voice, Who said they taught us democracy?

Along with seven councilors regulating autocracies

Deliberated our destinies but we were not there
Turned us to colonies, well God forgive them
Superior hominids, the way we view them
Don't be fooled Sir, all men are equal
Put a cut on any man, what's d colour of his serum?, The songs of our fathers always had a meaning
Regardless of the side that the crowd was leaning
With our art and our craft, we desired to see Him

Our forebears break-danced to the beats of bata

Dancing and flashing torches we scratched lockers with coins
To that African generation hip-hop was returned

Makes visions of private jets a blatant testament of destinies stolen

Return to that quiet place then, work, Nigerian child, and do not stop,

Do not stop, bring home those medals; excel in fields of song, of art, of poems told in tales by moonlight
Do not break rank; do not sit in silence,
Excel in education, we no longer care if its at home or abroad,
Tell of your Country in screaming, still silent words,
That proclaims our excellence in spite of homemade wars., Work, Nigerian child, and do not stop!
Until our individual victories shame our collective complacence,
Until our personal victories shroud corrupt practices,
Until ineptitude is unable to touch seats of power,
Until education rids us of diseases unnecessarily increasing mortality rates,
Until our sweat returns to us our heritage,

They are a rare act, being one of the few Muslim female outfits around and are unafraid to express themselves through the art of rhyme.Poetic Pilgrimage brings a refreshing perspective on issues of identity, immigration, and global politics and as one of the very few Muslim, female Hip Hop acts in the world, their music reflects this unique experience. The world has much to learn from the lyrics of these two women.Muneera Rashida and Sukina Abdul Noor were both born in Bristol to Jamaican parents, and have been performing together as Poetic Pilgrimage for 6 years. The early part of their career saw them as favorites on the London poetry circuit where they performed alongside some of the biggest names, placing them at the forefront of the fast-growing International Muslim Hip Hop scene. They use their music to unite their community with the greater hip-hop and music scene.Their musical goals are to make progressive Hip Hop music that fuses their African and Caribbean roots with their musical tastes such as Jazz, Afrobeat, Soul and beyond, providing a creatively comparable backdrop to their message of peace, unity and freedom.The group has toured all over Europe and the United States and have performed alongside artists such as Talib Kweli from the USA, K'naan from Somalia and Mutabaruka from Jamaica. They have received critical acclaim and press coverage from many of Europe's most notable publications.Whether helping youth learn to write heartfelt poetry, or rapping at the most male-dominated Hip Hop venues, Poetic Pilgrimage has become one of the most well-known and well-respected Muslim hip-hop crews in the world.",United Kingdom,"Bismilahi Rahman Al-Rahim., We Poetic Pilgrimage, we stand for peace, justice and equality.

and the righteous arise, use light to reverse the effects of Satan's curse.
It's getting worse on this earth, its ocean bank's burst, famine and drought, hunger and thirst., For the last will be first, out of nations dispersed. Diverse as stars, in this universe.  Perverse men disturb the humble who preserve Allah's majestic words and so are visual firm.

But still we pray, five times a day, and still we pray, five times a day., I seen it all before, death and destruction, I heard it all before,
greed and corruption. No more, no more war. No more no more war., In this world so consumed with vanity, I'm trying to find an ounce of sanity. Keep my steps in tune with the sighting of the moon, the rising of the sun.  That's how the west was won, I see stars in the horizon, clouds with silver lining, my soul's redefining. I spit skylines, push up peace signs in crews on front lines.
We stay undefined, to undermine the beast and those of its kind
in the midst of this paradigm.
I'm just reaching my prime, my optimus, no games, no fables, no lead tables, trying to live my life stable.
This ain't no stakeholdiing shares on my soul, nor for fame or for gold.
Shoot aim and offload, this time was foretold by wise men who were bold.
So we stay composed as the story unfolds.
Oh behold, as the story unfolds, fold, fold., I seen it all before, death and destruction, I heard it all before,
greed and corruption. No more, no more war. No more, no more war., Love, light, honesty, modesty, self respect. Love each other the same way you'd love your mother and pray for brighter days. Pray for a new tomorrow, pray for peace, pray for peace."

A YOUNG MOKOBA MAN
Open your ears and enjoy the words of the wordsmith
I only have a little, just a piece
Just a piece of poetry because I am not a gifted poet
I am just here to mimic poets
My heart has been bewitched with great charms of the Koba clan
By a tall and visionary Mokoba young man
With the charms that he got from the deepest beds of Thamalakane river
With the charms that hypnotised and blinded me
With a charm he cast a spell and hypnotised me
I mean the red charms
Real charms, real love that is burning and glittering like a motswere charcoal
Because of the person that I have chosen
Whom indeed I chose by the power of love
Since love does not need excuses nor words to justify
Weaker girls tried to attract his attention
He blatantly rejected their moves
Their hearts went all out bleeding and got disappointed like a hartebeest running towards a dry stream
Their hearts went all out bleeding and bitter as bile
The loincloth that makes men traverse and break marriages
I am a man of integrity
I am like a porcupine that digs the holes
I am firmly grounded
He says love consumes his heart like a worm when he thinks of his black lady
And shed a tear like rain drops
Blood quickly runs into my head
Running like Thamalakane streams channeling water from the big rivers
Oh my beautiful one
She who possesses a thin waist
I love her like the moon does to the west and stars
They say he who is blindfolded by love has no escapade
The world in which they live can drive them to utopia
Even though the road to love can be rough
He will never forsake me
He says my love for him flows like sea water
If it is a stream it could be overflowing
It could be overflowing and spilling"
Princely is a poet based in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. ,Tanzania,"And there are days I pine for your clay idols and
Banana leaf trinkets
Dirt brown charms on hips and limbs
That I picture swaying in a manfull wind
a righteous gyration for our lords., Where did you go to speak to them?
What were the signs you followed?
Did you wait for a full moon?
Did you watch for the blooms of the Masale?
Did Maanki lead a procession up the mountain?
Tell me Mkamasawe. , There are nights I stay up
dreaming of darker, older nights
torches and tongues flickering in the distance
You and I a few hundred feet
behind a few hundred faithful
and a forest darker, older than this sleeplessness, Was your high priest a love sick priestess?
Did she slaughter the sins of the tribe
into a few ox blood drops and a feast of mdafu?
Did you drink the blood?
For protein or purity?
Did you like it?, You cannot recognize me anymore and
Not because I have changed
I have questions you can not answer
Limp on that bed like that
You only speak in groans and whimpers and ululations now
and the odd smile, I wanna know about your youth
But I never may
I wanna know how it felt to be a child
when our glory
was all glory
The gods do not allow us to live long enough to ever savour
the here and now
So we dream of yesterdays
And learn from tomorrows, But where did you meet grandfather?
At a TANU Youth League rally?
At a dance by the Weru Weru?
At the German School where you became Lutheran?
tell me Bibi, I think there is a pang for libations
floating inside all of us black ones
and we drown it with Red bull and Jaggermeister
the things you know you'll never know
will kill you."
"Priscah Katlholo joined Poetavango Spoken Word Poetry in the early months of 2010. This dynamic and groundbreaking move was sparked by her friends who saw .òthe dirt I made on every paper I laid my hands on'.  These raw squiggles translated as poetry to Priscah's friends, who urged her to nurture and develop the art form. Thus, Priscah joined the Botswana's biggest poetry movement and adopted the nom de plume Priskath. She was born and raised in Maun, under the wings of her grandparents. Together with her cousins at the cattle post, they would gather around the fire and listen to her grandmother.òs great stories. Her grandfather used to poetically praise virtually everything on which their cultural sustenance depended, from rain to cattle. Though unbeknownst to her, those were the first seeds to be planted on her fertile literary farm. When Priskath started school she was already polished. Needless to say, she excelled in compositions and literature. Her writings are inspired by God and His art. She mostly writes about gender based issues but also touches on other critical life themes depending on what inspires her at that particular moment. As a young woman who adores the music and the power of the lyrics within, Priskath also gets her inspiration from well written Reggae and Country music lyrics.Her poetry expedition turned into a joyful adventure as she performed in every event that was organized by Poetavango. Being given the platform to perform in international events was indeed an honour and reinforcement of her talent. She performed in all the editions of the Maun International Arts Festival (MIAF) and in the Hundred Thousand Poets for Change (100TPC). Priskath yearns for the growth of poetry in Botswana. Unless and until poetry has reached the apex of its progression, she will not retire from the written and spoken word.
She says in her own words; .òThe word is of utmost importance. It was there at the very beginning and promised to be there at the very end, who then can deny the importance of the word.  We poets and other writers need to ensure that the word reaches the masses in every way possible. It's our God given duty.'Priscah Katlholo holds an Associate Degree in Public Relations from Limkokwing University of Creative Technology.
",Botswana,"What made us poets
Lies in the graves of our forefathers
We are led by freedom songs
Left not on walls but as part of this air
They are oxygen,
Our strength to hatch on our own
From egg shells as hard as stones
Every now our words shoot like mushrooms around ant hills
We never apologies to the truth
No .òifs' or .òfears'
Standing strong in the middle of our tears
We are made poets
To empower Africa for Africans
Who can't remember their skin colour in foreign soils
To Africans who never knew home
These poems are home
To Africans who never wore stenge or matalo
These poems are clothing
To Africans who blew whistles
These poems are horns
To those who worshiped in mosques and synagogues
These poems are hills
To our siblings who met death before time
Due to internal wars and hunger
These poems are life
Then to you and me who wish to write with feathers
These poems are permanent paint
To those who dream stars from colbates for they
Have the sky as their blanket
These poems are shelter
To me the dreamed poet
These poems are my yesterdays and tomorrows
To child soldiers fenced with fear and death
These poems cry's for their release
To my late grandfather, my late father,
My late uncle
These poems are continuation of their dream
These poems are for books that were never written
For perished cultures
For now for then and forever
These poems shall be established
For now for then and forever"

Please give a definite answer, so that my heart will be at peace
And so that I may wait with you at the door-step,
No need for you to knock., Don't leave me alone crying, and go on suffering,
And become over-come, with my heart full of torture
Please think of this for my sake, and show pity on me., I have no one to cheer me up, but you so and so alone,
You alone can cure me of this sickness, which dominates my heart
You alone can give me company and cheer,

Confuses the mind

On a traveler's road,
The madness of corruption
Permeates all over
Like bilharzias germs
In a human body,
Breton Woods and accomplices
Suck our blood
Like a million ticks
On an animal's body,
And the insolent ogres
Stuck on the reigns of power
Have encircled us
With barbed wire
Like dogs-of-war

Oh, golden dream
The dream of a morrow
Where crocodiles
Sun-bathing on red carpets
Will be yester tales
A morrow when
Libraries and laboratories
Will light the valleys
And the hills of Africa,
A morrow when
Children will walk in villages
Without being munched on the way
By measles and whooping cough
A morrow when
Children will lift their brain power
To the apex of the eucalyptus
Without being pulled down poverty,
A morrow when
Agricultural technology
Will kiss the land
To produce a super potato
Bigger than Africa
So that, to the rubbish heap we dish
This tin with which
With a smelly embarrassment
We make rounds around the globe
Begging for leftovers"
"Professor Keorapetse Willie Kgositsile, considered one of South Africa's most distinctive poetic voices since the l960s, is South Africa's National Poet Laureate.  Gwendolyn Brooks, the late poet laureate of Illinois, said of Kgositsile's work almost forty years ago:

I would say that he is a .òmaster', if it were not for my belief that no one .òmasters' anything, that each finds or makes his candle, then tries to see by the guttering light.  Willie has made a good candle. And Willie has good eyes.Kgositsile left South Africa in 1961 as one of the first young cadres of the African National Congress (ANC) instructed to do so by the leadership of the national liberation movement.  While doing his MFA at Columbia University in 1969 he started teaching literature and creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College in New York.  He has also taught at a number of other universities and colleges in the USA, including: Queens College, Bennett College, State University of New York at Stonybrook, University of Denver, Wayne State University, New School for Social Research, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).  In 1975 he returned to Africa and taught at a number of universities, including: the universities of Dar es Salaam, Nairobi, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Fort Hare.Professor Kgositsile has worked in various departments and structures of the ANC, both above and underground.  He was one of the founding members of the ANC's Education Department (1977), and the Department of Arts and Culture (1982).  He was also a founding member of the ANC Veterans League in 2009 and was a member of the ANC National Centenary Task Team.He was Special Adviser to former Ministers of Arts and Culture, Mr. Z. Pallo Jordan and Mr. Paul Mashatile. Kgositsile is one of the most widely published South African poets.  His work has been translated into many languages.  He has been the recipient of a number of literary awards, among them: the Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Prize; the Harlem Cultural Council Poetry Award; the Conrad Kent Rivers Memorial Poetry Award; the Herman Charles Bosman Prize.  In 2008 he was awarded the National Order of Ikhamanga: Silver (OIS).BOOKS PUBLISHED:

When Harriet Tubman
heard the thunder of the guns
and saw their terrible lightning
and the blood and the dead bodies
your voice was there, Your voice was born and borne

through enough to resolve
he would rather drink muddy water
sleep in a hollow log
than go to New York City
and be treated like a dirty dog, Sterling, we dub you itinerant
as troubadour here to testify
when your mojo hands call
we must go to reclaim our history
and resolve that no force on this planet
will ever fold our life into banknotes
as we create our future full of laughter

and the day will not claim them
how could you not testify

and son of the blues   , LETTER FROM HAVANA
            (for Baby K), A while back I said
with my little hand upon
the tapestry of memory and my loin
leaning on the blues to find voice:
If loving you is wrong
I do not want to do right, Now though I do not possess
A thousand thundering voices
like Mazisi kaMdabuli weKunene
nor Chris Abani's mischievous courage
as I trace the shape of desire and longing
I wish I was a cartographer of dreams
but what I end up with is this stubborn question:
Should I love my heart more
because every time I miss you
that is where I find you"

Or am I asking for a beating?
Is this the interpretation of my situation?
My nation punished by this situation
And we are under pressure
One by one picked
Like bullets from orchards
And we bewitched by the dop system
With fantastic words such as
Indifferent, ugly, systematic, misconduct
Each day raped financially
It's a power struggle
With the fluctuation of the rand
I see my budget buckle
Now stress becomes the new illness
I scratch for money in empty pockets
Now you tell me
What more must we suffer
Messing with our meat and water
I'm moving forward but feel I'm falling behind
Automatically the keeper of the ghetto's Rigterveilde
I sense the ugliness as it's directed
Steals and swaps our breath
With that fake pipe
And it's fake body
Come here
With all the sensationalism in the pages of newspapers,
Our refusal to rebel
And discuss the day's tabloid displays as well.
So you think what.òs my question might be
When will this constant suppression and theft of our children's land cease.
And this constant arguments and political distraction
What happens now should be sown as before
Children of district six
Children of the South Easter
Everywhere
To unite is important
To change the shame of past decisions
That sells bad newspapers
My people
My People
With soft belly's
Empty pockets
And wide posteriors
Across all borders
We are and can be this country true spirit
Khoe, San, Bantu and European
On the wall of the mountain it can be read
I am here because of the will of the Almighty
And through this my consciousness awakens
And releases
It should pollinate

To help our people
And has a return on dividend
For us
Yes for us."

For a while I was sympathizing
But instead of sympathizing, I started realizing, Realizing that you are peering through the eyes of truth
The eyes of truth attracting window shopping at the soul
The soul looking for a clue
A clue to what would possess a youth to go down such a route
A route that could lead to death
His early death his mother could have never expect, Expect that the good die young but the bad live old,
Old enough for your head to be pierce with a hole
A whole day's wage is enough to make a whole dollar,
A whole dollar is enough to make .òem stick kids holla'
So holla' at a child with the strive to survive in his eyes
Cause in his eyes you either see the reflection of a gun, a book or a knife
A Knife to slice the lies that were told to us throughout life

In the rain where hearts broken and spirits are trying to maintain
Maintain peering through the eyes of a child, can you sense that pain?, That pain some may over look
Over look the Young and feeble
Feeble and Hungry for knowledge will we let that brain become un-feed-able
Un-feed-able but not undefeatable because through the eyes of a child all things are possible
Possible that society impetus a child to become a man
But man, what does it mean to a man if he does not understand?
Understand what it means to be a child
A child, Jesus said we should be like
Like them because they are meek and mild
(See) Mild is not how you describe the aura of the streets
The Streets is the devil's playground
The devil's playground is where the Lion is looking for some meat, Meet the parents, who do not equip their children with knowledge as weaponry
Weaponry to be able to fight to achieve a dream
(See) Dreams that are not protected are fast to break
Fast to break to become breakfast in the harsh reality of society, Through the eyes of a child there are no boundaries
No boundaries in the eyes of a child he is a bird flying free
Free through the eyes of a child is a world full of fun
Fun that the stove is cold, tho' the heat is on
(But) On television the price is right
Right to give the unprotected mind a surprise
Surprise that everything in life has a price
Price-less is the eyes of a child, See the eyes of a child will eventually become a man's
(But) a man's demands are to be able to look through the eyes of his own child
(And) His own child can then understand
Understand that opportunity is endless
(and) endless opportunity is what one should see
When peering through the eyes of a child
Because the eyes of a child at risk was once me"

"Raised in a musical family, the poet grew up singing in a traditional Setswana choral choir where the inspiration to perform for the masses was natured and harnessed through leading some songs and doing the poetry to fuse with the music as is part of dikwaere. He then evolved through the inspiration from his mum and listening to different types of music like reggae, rock & roll, kwaito, hip hop and for the most part the ability to appreciate different art forms. The artist first performed solo at the age of eleven at a kgotla gathering in Tutume village in Botswana doing a welcoming piece for the dignitaries at the gathering. He then evolved to take part in different shows all the way through to high school. And in 2005 he started documenting his written work in a compilation called <strong>Smoking Poetree volume 1</strong> with a collection of more than a hundred poems and short stories to be published. The artist also works as a freelance copywriter for marketing and design agencies and he does special performances on corporate and social events. He continues to rock stages with his simple and straight forward and easily palatable to all yet thought provoking and highly entertaining poems. His work is mostly aligned towards activism, awareness and Africanism. With an excellent standing ovation record of 11 consecutive shows and counting he has been pointed as a favorite poet by many poetry lovers locally and internationally.",Botswana,"Just wanted to see if you are nice and comfortable
To see if you are well tucked in and flexible
For you need space to turn space to learn new things
Yet you also have to be cozy and warm
Protected from the strange and the unknown
But not denied the chance to indulge and engage with the new
A moment to lace up those dancing shoes
Let them control your feet lost in the rhythm
So sleep, sleep my child , Sleep for tomorrow is a new day, a new light
But sleep for its your spoils today cos Yesterday you conquered,
The questions of yester night's wonders has been answered
Rest your head slow as I command the pillows to be gentle
Yes the pillows perhaps that's just about all I can handle
For I cannot command the world out there
The row the rumble of the roads
Barking and baaring of the dogs and goats
I cannot control the pulse of this earth
I will not even attempt for what its worth
I will not try to understand all the conversations of morning
Am not the one to explain mother earth's intensions
So you can lay down and breath, yes breath
Breath to the pattern of your song
The world out there has its own
So sleep, sleep my child , Sleep and open your heart some more
U might just discover secrets hidden down below
Let themes of purple and pink adorn your world
As you become the supreme of dream world
Sleep, sleep for in your sleep fantasy becomes real again
There only two things you can increase your own
By simply giving it out more
And that's education and love
The more you teach the more you learn
The more you love the more you get adored
Sleep you don't even have to listen this poem
As you just have to sleep, so sleep child
Sleep with no worries but a smile
Sleep it might pronounce your dimples
Sleep as the day evens out with the night
And the stress reconciles with the peace
The eyes hits a compromise with the dark
Sleep you don't even have to count sheep
Sleep child, sleep, Sleep for when you sleep in your heart
That's where the sun rests
And the moon converses with the stars in your head
About with part of the world to shine bright tonight
Child in your womb souls gets molded as they prepare
To meet the seed to walk this earth and
Eventually become gods and goddesses
So sleep my child, sleep and give the universe a hug
Embrace and give it a kiss on the Venus
So sleep and renew thyself for you are the universe
Sleep the universe needs a rest and a rebirth
As you wake up fresh in the next day
As you get ready to celebrate again
Its you birth day again world
And the good gets to score against the bad, So sleep, sleep my child sleep
Sleep, sleep

My mistress of multitude return, When we rode a void of ten thousand miles
Against the copious currents of the Niger, The raucous river in your right eye trembled
Now I cannot shake off the orgasmic smiles, You stitched my soul with rafters in your barnyard
And unbuckled my bones on your bed of broken vows, Tonight I sit solitary sad at the harmatan
Blowing loneliness from the trees of fractured boughs, The moon is full in our sleeping bag
And the owls are crooning in bare branches, Gone is the cocoon of your delicate embrace
And the heavy chainsaw of our sticky screwing, But with my penis I will Jump into your bottomless pit
Good morning Dambudzo Marechera"
"Rantoloko .òThe Truth' Molokoane is a writer from the unknown township of Tumahole in the Free State, South Africa. He went to Primary School at Botjhabatsatsi Intermediate until grade 4, and then changed schools to Hendrik van der Bijl in Vanderbijl Park where he completed his grade 7. He matriculated in 2003 from Suiderlig High School. He has an S4 in Chemical engineering and is currently studying for his BA with Unisa.He is the author of Read, Write Dreams Into Life published in August 2011. Read, Write Dreams Into Life is Rantoloko Molokoane's debut literary text. It is the culmination of a decade of writing. The book is a collection of poems and prose writing that carry his signature view of the world in which reality is not only viewed at face value, but holistically. This view is the foundation of his philosophy that reality isn't as rigid as it is deemed, as most of what we experience is the creation of men. The book deals with reality in its creation paradigm and not its existent paradigm, so as to provide the reader with the confidence to face their realities however diverse.
For a decade now he has been practicing his craft, nurturing it and learning ways to better tell the Afrikan story. In two thousand and one he turned his mind away from academics and began to observe human behavior in all its absurdity and from there the writing began. In 2008 he quit his job after finding himself immersed in unending depression because of a lack of utilization of his mind which led to extreme drinking. Since then he has been working tirelessly at his writing. Now with only a few years passed he has expanded from merely just writing poetry to even fiction novel (still being written). His work has been featured on One-2's album .òMicrophone blank cheqk and on Inaudible poetry's .òComprehension' compilation. Besides writing he has horned in on his experience of performing poetry for seven years to produce edgy performances that shatter limitations with their fusion of enactment and poetry so as to bring life to poetry. He has performed around Gauteng tertiary institutions like VUT where he was exposed to the world of performing; TUT, NWU, UJ and at venues like Cramers coffee at Balladry composition's poetry shows. He has also had the pleasure of performing at the Word N Sound Series hosted by Afurakan at the Bassline coming second on two occasions and at the KPN session held at Market Theatre Lab hosted by Jefferson Tshabalala. He has performed alongside some of the greatest poets like Romeo the poet, Inaudible poetry, and Quaz, and musical talents such as The Soil and Travellin Blak.
His writing is driven by the rich spiritual heritage of Afrika and the immense creativity that lies in the depth of its heritage. Driven by that he has found ways of writing material that awakens all to the realization that what we deem to be reality is but a mere fragment of a bigger reality that exists where creation moulds what we finally see. Adamant that imagination is the key to breaking the bondages that anchor us in a reality that seeks to diminish us into the confines of a reality of those who have learnt to use creation to their bidding, he writes awe-inspiring image centred writing that challenges the reality that Afrikans are faced with by exposing the hidden boundaries of what is. A strong believer in the quest to findings ways of celebrating Afrikan indigenous knowledge systems so as to once again instil pride in the Afrikan, especially the one battling with a township reality that instils despair in the minds of the Afrikan.
.òMore than a writer I am a mere township boy who read to the point of seeing beyond the blinding surface of all.'",South Africa,"He was staring into the night sky as it bled
from its womb lessons in the form of beauty.
His eyes wide shut, having been stapled closed
by mother nature's nurturing touch.
His mind as still as the carnage we ceremoniously deploy
into boxes, that are then later concealed.
Six feet far from our tormented souls.
Oh hail all things seen
one day will fade and never be seen.
Oh hail all things seen
one day will fade and never be seen.
His possessed mouth began to utter
possessed by the magic exuded by the invisible angel.
Illuminated by the glance of that unselfish king
that reigns only at night.
Then it all ended and all that was left,
was a face that seemed to have been
supernaturally reconstructed into a smile.
Residues of this impermanent event.
And I stood addled
I the god, creator of this haven of madness.
A meticulously crafted painting, with strokes from the unknown
another product of insanity.
I the prisoner, shackled to elusive poles of limitations.
By thoughts, perceptions, the tools of the mind.
The mind, the very prison I am confined in
the puppet, attached to the mind by strings of thoughts.
To reap torturous movements when emotions pull.
I understand nothing, seek nothing.
For too many a time have I thrown pebbles of thoughts
upon the surface of this perceived ocean
of comprehension, seeking a destination
where purpose and sense can be found.
But only for this ocean to swallow them
and I being attached drowned to a mere human.
A worshipper of the untold tale
of the ice maiden that fell in love with the sun,
Seeking nothing else but to serve
the sun's heart with platters of eternal euphoria.
A tragic tale that still flows
in the crevices of this life, intoxicating seekers
farmers that water the seeds of suffering
that deeply in the fields of their lives
with their tears.
And if poetry be another medium that perpetuates understanding
then consider this as ramblings of the consciousness
scribbled in the book of life.
I, the god that never understood creation."

"Razaq Ivori is a prolific writer who began his career in writing as a ghost pen for the rich and famous. He wrote their auto biographies for a fee until his last book Elevating the Women for Mrs Titi Atiku. He moved on to the institute of journalism where he studied multimedia techniques and began working for an Abuja firm soon after his HND in journalism.His literary works include blood and kin a Sci-Fi African drama piece and the adventures of illinick slyed a radio drama written for the BBC but was never submitted.His current literary scheme is to bring back the art of the quintessential Town Crier poetic semantics: he dubs narrative news. A system where actual news content is infused in free flow prose rendition though in English but not without the characteristic melodic chant of the past.For six months Ivori premiered this art at the Bogobiri lounge in ikoyi, where some say the uproar it generated prompted the proprietors to establish a full scale stage house next door for performance poetry.
Today the poet, writer, journalist has put all away to make his theatric experiment a reality. The full content like he humbly puts it will give birth to SAO THE STANDERD AFRICAN OPERA.",Nigeria,"I was a town crier told to tell a tale of sixpence

of the street where rhythm rises
then crashes underneath our feet,
all those false notes of childhood
when in winter she sang herself to sleep
the song of students with no shoes,
notes suddenly flat now beneath bare feet.
There are false true notes at jazz concerts
I have listened to, many till their end
where they died, and there found
one must dance with them, painful
as it is, and hold in such meaning
the savour of their triumph of love
in a dynamic ritual of a last chance,
arms coiled in a martial stance
as the foot stamps last sounds out
of each note, and in twilight
make the brilliance come out,
and people home-bound after work
stop, watch, wash off their day toil,
faces hung around her, maybe to wall
the moment in, or wall another out,
in tune with her soul."
"Richard Mbuthia is an English and Literature teacher in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Poetry is his second love: the rhythm, verse and verve of poetry are ingredients of a great love story. The twenty six letters of the alphabet amaze him with their ability to be used as instruments of change .ì their volatility, pointedness, efficiency and aptness cannot be gainsaid. His ambition is that one day he will be a poet of high repute; a poet churning out metres and metres of verse; a poet on the drawing board of many a winning verse; a poet charting the way for revolutionary pieces; a poet telling the African story as it is and as it ought to be.
",Tanzania,"A sham, bloody deception,
The bounding, white army chanted.
Undemocratic, unparalleled injustice,
The tardy (nay, tacky), black army chorused.
Unrivalled travesty, perfect ambiguity,
The International community whimpered.
But the black man stood, unstung,
The virulent words falling on barren ears.
.úKeep your noises to yourselves,.ù
He advised the white and black alike.
The bandying of coloured words ensued,
All parties pulling the frayed reins.
Just before the snap of the frayed joints,
The black man cleared his sooty throat:
.úIf thou deemest yourselves clean enough,
Be the first to hurl disjointed pebbles!.ù
The white and black armies cast unfurled glances,
And voluntarily retreated to their murky hovels."

was rounded silver.
Inside, sweat sparkled.
Hawkins had a voice
inside his tenor, liquid silver.
Mythic insects leapt inside his voice.
Hawkins recorded with Ellington
once only, 1962.
They did a number of tunes
including Mood Indigo, in one take.
That's nothing, you might say
if you want nothing less than liberation,
but did you hear that tone ?
Like tarnished silver.
Ellington was confi dent enough,
having written the tune,
and his odd punctuations
on the piano seemed to say
yes, Hawk, yes,
there is nobody quite like you.
Hawkins, who could turn a phrase
to blue-green, or the shape of a knife,
played from the edge of a dark dream.
Ray Nance brought out his violin
as the dust on the studio window ledge
brightened in the sun
and played to ask Why? Why?
for the unemployed machinist
in the bar across the street.
Music has the power
to loosen obscure emotions
says Hexagram 16, along with several warnings,
and the trader in Diagonal Street
sells the same cheap watches,
only they are quartz and digital now
and really do keep time,
and from Rashid Vally's record shop
the same twenty-year-old sounds
from the dead Duke and the dead Hawk
ionise the air and soothe the silent crowds."

Is it the moving the looming, the fear it might attack
our minds, our souls, our skin.
Trickling
Etching into our being,
leaving the mark of despair?, Fair? Fair?
All we aspire to,
When the colour of this continent is black.
A black thread connecting form Cape to Cairo,
But still, denotations and connotations grow
And old beliefs are not let go
of black as a savage force seeking to control., Black the soul, the colour of coal and oil
Which gives rise to economic size,
But yet we toil and deny that black supplies
Our roots.
A mould of a people of early times,
of unity, simplicity, when all that existed was black., Black, black. I am black
I wear my black, I swear my black,
I track my black skin and see in it
Greats' retold, past spirits unfold
in the wide leaping black., I embrace my black and let it envelope me like shadows attached
loud, proud, .òcause black don't crack,
dark is lovely,
black is beautiful,
mysterious, yet definitive not abstract., But the name of black has been blackened by a black people,
who have driven back the name of black.
Where Africans seek to be South Africans.
Black is coloured lighter, and coloured is coloured whiter,
all out of spite for black., Where, every definition of black has become abject.
Black hole, black sheep, black magic,
So tragic, that we are so scared of black.
Black looming, black moving.
A sordid past we re inact when we deny out heritage of black."

no less her pimps and molesters
no less her rapists
than whatever scarred the black back
of the exposed left thigh
than whatever strewed the crack vials
crunching under her heels
than whatever convinces her
to readjust the halter every 30 seconds, she fades into the bright white distance
and into our imaginations
past the grade schoolers
jumping rope and cussing
in front of the Shiloh Baptist Church of the Redeemer
past the corner where Shaqwan's 13 year old blood
muddied up the sidewalk
past the four hair-dressing salons
the three take-out Chinese food restaurants
the two liquor-stores jeweled
with bullet-proof glass, and the stench is still with us
a nuclear mushroom-cloud
but this is just how the neighborhood smells, like gun metal and acid
and struggle
and gym shoes   and struggle
and crabs in a barrel    and struggle
and police cars
and little girls aspiring to video hair-dos
and struggle
and gentrification     and struggle
and the armpits of the second racist mayor in a row
and struggle
and struggle

our skulls, then knock our souls
from us. It is so. For under stars
that are but burning stone,
we held each other. Named for light,
Nurbibi clung to me, her back
against the flat roof of my house
warding off earth, hanging
under heaven. Face-down,
I gripped her shoulders, smelled
the stone roof through the rug.
Nurbibi may have stared
over my shoulder at the stars,
those burning bits of far-off stone., And she may have seen four men's eyes
hanging above us in their own,
unmoving flame. Eyes of stone,
heads shrouded in swathes
of scripture. So I, Turyalai,
am bound. And on my knees.
And Nurbibi, in whose loins I sought
some God, is now almost at one
with earth, buried to her waist
next to me. We wait
for the seekers of God
and their ceremony of the stone.
Men we do not know will come
and let stone speak, first in whispers, then in what they must believe
a chattering of angels
when the crowd erupts and rocks arc
but in parabolas far short
of reaching God, that must return
to earth. Men who do not know us.
Men who cannot know
that even as we wronged my wife,
in union we created God. In come-cries
caught in the throat, we made Him.
And made Him ours, gave Him some voice
even as He was in the still of night
as He is now, inchoate
before the hard and burning stars., Turyalai and Nurbibi were accused of adultery and
stoned to death by the Taliban in November 1996."

alongside the highway
under a tree
along the fence I walked to them
reading names heavy with someone's longing
none of the Khadijas I found were you Katy
I saw a man with a prayer book in his hand
standing as still as the trees and
I didn't want to break what he had by the
leaves that would have crushed under my foot
and I left
not having found you
but knowing that the prayer I sent from my car
will get to you somehow
we could picnic in your cemetery
the sweeping spaces clipped green
and neat
the benches good for cupping us
between the hum of traffic
and the slow hush of grass
sectioned off by census of faiths
in death too we choose to lie close to our own
you would have told me so
perhaps it is that when we rise again
it will be among comforting commiserators
or if we did happen to call upon God by a rightful name
there'd be no rubbing our neighbours' noses
in more dirt than they were accustomed to
red mounds of heaped soil for most Muslim graves
green perspex stenciled names
prayers for the highest stages in Heaven
among the few entombed and headed by
granite supplications more adamant
and then there are some with a clutch of
scratched-on plywood sticks
like plant markers
these grave gardens
grief wistfulness tend
careful beds of succulents
blooms flourishing both wild and contained
in pots and vases like
ornaments in your mother's display cabinet
I will return to look for your tree
in this nursery of loving wives devoted husbands
dear friends and fallen angels
I will look for you  in the golden hour
when the day draws over your grave
gentle and warm God tucking you in for the night
and it feels like we're nearing
the end of something perhaps
a hope that Death will not sneak up behind us
but walk towards us giving us
time to prepare."

Because we are victims of a revelation that was contrived, I sit on the threshold as I behold a party of pilgrims from across the bridge
Their bodies frozen cold as a fridge
We revolutionaries sit on the edge of pain like cow dung on farm ridge
Like black butterflies blown by contrary winds and ditched
Hope and anger linger together hook line and sinker like tuna about to be fished
Their intelligence make me want to say ish
What do they think you are
Tell me
A foolish young village belle looking to be hitched?
Ish
Again then,I am but an extension of my pen
An expression of my pain
I am saying
My revolution will be televised
Because I possess a revelation that needs not to be revised, We are being threatened by theories of evolution that was foolishly contrived, We suffer as if by electrocution
That's how our souls are bein sensitised
The powers that seem to be deem to only have our minds lobotomised
Automation by evolution's proponents is the goal of this counter
revolution and its pungent
These people are mere agents of an unknown civilisation
And as you get older you get colder
In your pseudo life of a soldier
You look like a washed out
Washed thru
Washed up
Washed in
Has been
That's been
Living
In a bin
Living on gin and cigarette filters
Filthy
Feeling guilty
Cos yo failure is your monument
You fail to grasp your moment
You are an orchid set in cement
Blaming everyone else but yourself for your up ending internment
Free yourself from prison
The prisms of your ego
Be like me
Fight the system that be
Can't you see
You are valued less than they value a tree
Screw your civility
What is civil about a war
That's not a revolution
That's your evolution of evil
The madness of a people gone ill
Symptomatic of the hand of the devil
Why do you want to rise and kill
That's ill
Yet still
My revolution must be televised
My people must be sensitised
This reality should no longer be romanticised
No need too late to apologise, Have you seen icy tears slither from a cold heart thru eyes not there
Have you felt pain you couldn't shed a tear
Have you had fright you couldn't shudder in fear
Has apathy hit you like a zulu spear
As reason and emotion morph none any longer clear
And yet you arch to hear
The word in your ear
Visions and appaeitions spoken by this seer
And if its true that life's best are free
Why is free this dear
The drumbeat of this revolution draws near
And this revolution must be televised
And even if my revolution was contrived
The evolution of my revolution is so every man woman boy and girl can
truly claim we are free
Do you agree"

Go to the water and swim, pour it by the balloon fulls
It is not fire, I refuse, the remedy for fire is water., 4.I see that it does not follow, to add intensity
Where it burns you do not go near, although shoes are heavy
Putting it out won't happen, if you add coal to a fire
It is not fire, I refuse the remedy for fire is water., 5.I simile when saying, that when a house catches fire
Almost too much water is poured on it, water from lakes and rivers
The remedy is JAINO, open your eyes
It is not fire, I refuse, the remedy for fire is water., 6.I believe that that is right, what I say sticks
And that that is its remedy, when it comes to fighting fire
For it will never burn, something that is green and fresh
It is not fire, I refuse, the remedy for fire is water., 7.There is nothing to move forward with, that is beyond my limit
I do not see nor persuade, to be discussing a heavy word
However a spark won't stop it, to put water to fire
It is not fire, I refuse, the remedy for fire is water."

And people of generation seX know what I'm talking bout.
When I first moved out and into my email address
that's when I became technologically promiscuous.
I was scandalous.
I started meeting guys in back rooms, Yahoo chat rooms.
Having cyber sex with men on the first conversation.
Sexin' them up in virtual coffee shops and College Clubs
and never seeing them again.
I had one chat stands
till 5:00 in the morning on Black Planets.
I had buddy lists full of chat dicks
I started buying Chap Stick from Internet pharmacies.
My closest friends were alarmed at me
because I was a hot girl sending Hotmail and being trife
doing things I would never do in real life.
I used to type 60 Jezebellian words per minute
to 2 and 3 men at a time.
Dropping my panties at the drop of a dime., But then, I started getting viruses
from cyber ejaculations aka attachments.
My P.C. contracted STD's
so I refused to even let at an erection
into my inbox
without getting some protection.
Because I was meeting dudes from 16 to 60 years old
from Macaulay Culkin to Geraldo
from Colorado to Sexico
I stopped buying rubbers from Texaco
and started buying them online.
I even stopped coming to class on time
b/c I met a man who sounded fine.î
he had black hair, dimples, and chocolate eyes
his name was Pecan Pie and was 6'5.ù
or at least that's what it said on his profile., Sooner or later, Pecan Pie stopped being Real Player
and became my #1 e-mailer.
When he became my boyfriend.
I gave up my toyfriends
and enrolled in Internet classes.
Never in all my Google eyed fantasies
did I imagine a love like this.
I wanted Pecan Pie to be the father of my kids.
One night we eloped on AOL and was married
went on a chat room honeymoon in Paris.
We consummated our marriage in the Amazon with Monsters.com
b/c when we were dating, we were on good behavior.
We cruised around the World Wide Web on Netscape's Navigator
and whenever we felt lost and there was anything we needed
we were told to go Ask Jeeves
and would you believe that Pecan Pie was ready for me
to be the mother of his baby so soon?
We consulted a doctor in a chat room
and to our surprise we could choose the color of our baby's eyes,
hair texture, sex, and height.
By the next night much to our Excite
we were at Adobe Photoshop getting a sonogram
b/c it was the baby's first bi-mester.
My friends thought I was crazy
b/c I was married with fetus in one semester., And then something bad happened.
The next day my baby arrived
and I tried to open its attachment
and my computer crashed.
The technician said this virus was deadly
my P.C had contracted HIV
from the night Pecan and I were married
and I didn't even know it
my computer never showed it.
Pecan Pie I trusted
I didn't care that he wasn't tested
or that we weren't protected.
But he was messing around on me
opening other women's attachments
putting my PC and our baby at risk., And now my baby was dead.
It took me a few minutes to clear my head but then
I used the computer of a friend
and Pecan said he wanted to make amends,
try for another baby, go to online counseling
but instead I downloaded divorce papers in his memory
and didn't care if he signed them.
B/c I signed out and started to live my life again."

It's a eulogy from one dark skinned sista
To another
There are times in our society when
Dark skinned women are not considered beautiful
It is not done to be darker than one expected standards
One just wants to hide away
To hide the shame and the stigma
Of being called darker than most, Some succumb to the shame
They bleach their beautiful skins
In order to conform to what is considered the beautiful complexion
They unwittingly destroy their beauty
Throw away the skin lightener my beautiful sister
Throw it away
Because you are the true beauty of Africa
And the essence of her being
She reared you from the richness of the soil
And you are her vision, You are beautiful, and let no one tell you otherwise
With your natural and supple brown skin
That brings out the beauty of your eyes
And the brightness of your smile
Your delectable chocolate skin that needs no make up
And does not burn in the sun
Your natural earth tones that define you
And the beauty that becomes you"

defines my state of mind-freeze frame-
I'm speaking Nasir Jones -All I need is one mic frame of mind-
that means I flip to verse 2 line 3-Jesus died at the age of33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
do I wanna die at 33?
See 33 to you may just be a number
but to me -it's symbolic of both the historic and the futuristic
see, my Muslim brothers believe that when you die and you go to Heaven,
you exist eternally at the age of 33
my christian brothers believe that 33 stands for truth,
that good will always conquer evil
but I'm a little devil, i only speak with a pessimistic point of view
but yet find me at a pew,
with a new set of knee pads praying hard to the Virgin Mary also called
the Virgin of the 33
or better yet, give me a pen and paper and I'll calculate from Dan
Brown's Da Vinci code the fibonacci set of numbers 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33, do I really want to be Jesus?
Let's see-Jesus, born to a Virgin and a carpenter-died at 33, fullstop.
Not quite?
Handel's Messiah defined him thus-he was despised, despised and
rejected
a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
he gave his back to the smiters and his cheeks to them that plucked off
the hair
and he hid not his face from the shame and spitting of the Pharisees
going frantic and hysteric-waving their crucifix, you'd think it was
Eminem in Renegade
then a dove came down as he bathed in Holy water
at that moment he became the rock of Gilbraltar
taking walks on water, and changing wine from water
an outgoing fellow he had a 40 day date with the devil
temptation was a loaf of bread-I wonder what was for dessert
then open the x files for the paranormal and find Lazarus brought back
to life
and yet-all his life
-he never spoke English, he only spoke parables
fed 5000 people everytime his tummy rumbled
had 12 disciples addicted to his every word-they should go into rehab
or better yet-throw in some erotica and call that flick-9 n a half
weeks
then some idiot named Iscariot goes Judas or if a gal, Judith
and kissed him on the cheek what happened next-Mel Gibson made some
cash
-call it The Passion of the Christ
but before he died-he cried saying Eli Eli Rama Sabachtani
My God My God-why did you forsake me?, I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33, but lose the religion
-I believe in the idea
the idea that being Jesus means walking with Mahatma Gandhi-speaking
the philosophy of satygraha
-truth and fairness-
believing in educating myself like Booker T Washington
and understanding
understanding-that the difference between the Black and the white
Church is that our forefathers were cross bearers
and that if I keep my butt on the bus for the right cause-I could
change life's course like Rosa Parks and be free
free to speak the breath of Corazon Aquino with the vocal gait of
Pavarotti
free to be at Bloody Sunday and leave there bloody
free to march to the Lincoln memorial with the man who dreamt up a
revolution
yes Tracy Chapman-talking about a revolution sounds like a whisper
but I'll whisper to them the revolutionary words of Dedan Kimathi
-I'd rather be dead, than alive on my knees
I guess I'll be dead at 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33
I said, Jesus died at the age of 33

"Sandhya was born on the North Coast of Kwa-Zulu Natal in 1987. She grew up in the quaint village of Seatides which is situated along the sugar-cane belt of the Tongaat district. As a child her irrepressible curiosity often resulted in painful consequences. She was not content with the banal knowledge that the switch turns on the light. No. She had to know how hot the bulb actually burnt. Fortunately this precocious, mischievous mind was soon harnessed by the creative outlets of poetry and short story writing. She matriculated from Seatides Combined School at the age of 16. After working an assortment of part-time jobs she moved to Cape Town to complete a diploma in Audio Engineering at the Cape Audio College. Since then Sandhya has completed a B.A. (Hons) degree in English Language and Literature Studies at the University of Cape Town.Sandhya currently plans to forge links with local NGOs that share her vision for equitable access to tertiary education across the nation's polarised socio-economic landscape.",South Africa,"Why don't you come and visit by me?

Keep that cold out., Maybe its good you're going just now.
No time to notice the cracks or smell on these moldy chairs.
But there's nothing on you.
You're always moving, heaving eager breathing.
So you won't catch on dust- not on that soft suede jacket.
Better go now. Go on.
You drank my tea; it wasn't mine to serve.
You bided your time. You sipped on mine.
You like it?Here? This one here.
Take some more for your flight back.
She won't mind or know.
Nobody comes here anymore."

feeding on our love and kindness
thirsting for our love, They lay hungry on a bed of passion
with their hearts ajar
uncertainty creeps into their hearts' little cracks
bathed in love yet dry with anxiety
you questioned their hearts
but they answered with fears
their insecurities bathed in frostiness. , They live among us
feeding on our kindness
thirsting for our love, They dream in music but the sleep on thorns
poisonous arrows pass through their hearts
stung by fear for passion
fleshed ripped with insecurity
they walk a crooked line of broken dreams
murmuring cold whispers that bring doubts
their silent symphony so loud, They breathe among us
feeding on our kindness
thirsting for our love, Fountain of tears stream down their cheeks
choked by emotion no words can they speak
caged around walls of darkness
obsessive uncertainty blinding their souls
their skin tightened around their eyes
sweat beading screening truth
not knowing right from wrong, They lie among us
feeding on our kindness
thirsting for our love, Our unconditional love never satisfies them
our tender embraces never warm enough
our lonely cries never move them
Greed ripping through their bodies
The teeth of uncertainty
clench  and grind around them
like steel claws on slate they cling to their hearts
with a sharpened hold turmoil strike on them
their caged cold hearts refusing to let us in
shutting us out beyond death
only cold air within their clasp, Whenever we reach out
We find nothing for our hands to touch
realizing the sudden bland flavour of our lives
no longer drawing out our breath
we drown us in their pool of sorrow
puncturing into our spine
grimly drilling holes through, Yes, they are indeed among us
calling us friends
lovers
companions
promising to be there
but only to feed on our sadness., Like the raging fire intense emotions well up
Shrinking their souls as they penetrate
The coldness of their souls stinging us
With shuddered grasp we pull back
Clutching our hearts they wrench them out
Stomping on our trust like yesterdays trash
Angels cry as innocent souls they crush
Life of the innocent drain out
Wasted, spent, lost, wrung
droplets of red staining the soil
taking us on a rollercoaster of pain
burrowing into our flesh
tenaciously ripping tunnels through
Yes, they live among us. , terrified and alone
terrified of their spirits
terrified of their choices
hiding behind hardness
hiding from the truth
not knowing there to turn
not trusting themselves
not sure of their future. , They feed on crushing our love
choking our laughter
they breathe on perforating our lives
feeding on our kindness
they walk among us
thirsting for our love"

That people go and come.
That friends come and go.
That lovers come, go or stay.
Some disappear with no signs, Some hover and flee.
Some blink green and then,
Blow cold, dead air.
Your best done matters not., Some wow and weave through
Your strings of life's jolly rides.
Few take trips to the earth's ends and rims;
Journeying through your grief and losses.
Your best done matters little., Some steal and destroy.
Your time stolen and gone like
Shooting stars and winds.
Hearts stolen and broken,
Ripped apart,
Left to mingle with dust and blood.
Lives caged.
Poked at,
Shackled with societal creed,
Culture's noose and religious handcuffs.
Minds mindlessly, travelling to wish-cities
Where the ones they love do not want to be
To love them back., Shackles and ironies.
Truths and roots., Tree roots of strength, realities and self love
All springing up in soul orchards., Seek, water it!, What's real as truth?
It's true about the whispering winds
And the stormy storms., It will remain through all these.
It remains true about these,
True love and more!"

to reach the cottages that
sit primly at the water's edge.
Purple flowers decorate the dry hillside,
amethysts around a sun-burnt neck.
A pin oak extends delicately
towards the sky. Horses mull.
Earlier, on the open road, her car flanked a train
as it probed the landscape, like a man entering a woman.
On her stereo, Alanis Morisette's lyrics blare
The words summon his face like an avatar:
sad clear eyes, thin-lipped mouth, jutting nose
swimming up in her mind like insistent fish.
Hours later, drunk, she leaves the birthday party,
to walk to where she will sleep that night
and lies on her bed, listening to the sounds of frogs
calling out across the water.
Laughter floats in through her open window,
like a half-drawn breath.
She remembers his words about her poems:
earnest, direct, removed.
Offering structure, a skeleton beneath flesh.
She scrawls in her notebook as a swimmer, fearful, under water
might search the opacity for a handhold, the roughness of rock.
She writes tentatively, as one standing up, walking to shore
might feel mud and soft lake moss beneath her feet, yielding."

When she was twelve, soldiers came for her,
dragged her into the back of a grey truck., She counted the number of blossom trees
between her home and the barracks: 87., Every thing that gave her
peace in that place, she named a god:, .úYou,.ù she said to the miso soup, .úare the god of bellies..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to her sisters' back, .úare the god of warmth..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to the cricket, .úare the god of funny music..ù, Comfort Woman believed her gods slept
when the soldiers took her every night., She would not believe that they had abandoned her.
She would not believe that a bayonet was better than a man., She learned to love the smell of bleach in hospital pillows,
found salvation in a spoiled rice grain., .úYou,.ù she said to her scars, .úare the god of memory..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to the lice, .úare the gods of sharing..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to her shame, .úare the god of humanity..ù, The tatami never became a good bed, Comfort Woman was
a princess who could feel the pea and the springs., The day the soldiers cried she knew the war was over.
Only the end of war could keep them from her sisters,, prostrating themselves in suicide positions in the dirt,
brimming with honor and despair. , She had seen that kind of face before.
For Comfort Woman the war would never be over., .úYou,.ù she said to their tears, .úare the god of retribution..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to the river, .úare the god of baptisms..ù
.úYou,.ù she said to the distant train whistle, .úare the god of freedom..ù, 2.

trying to find the barcode on a video,, helped her without request,
traded gestures until we found our tongue., She left the room, then returned, saying,
.úCoffee break.  You are so kind,.ù, Four pieces of candy sat, warmed my palm.
Comfort Woman does not believe in unpaid kindnesses., Comfort Woman prayed to fifty-two different gods back then,
and still lights incense to most of them., Some of them did not follow her to this place.
Some of them changed faces and bay at the sun., I unwrapped a lemon drop immediately,
set it on my tongue in front of her., She needed to know that her treasures would not end up
at back tables in staff rooms or slipped into trash cans.   , She needed to know that I believe in the same gods she does.
She needed to know that cricket song sounds the same to me,
and that her treasures will never just be candy., .úYou,.ù I say to paper, .úare the god of fortune..ù
.úYou,.ù I say to the pen, .úare the god of chance..ù

Maar, julle begin nou om julle-self soos kafirs te dra.
Dit is soos ons voorheen ges√™ het.
All you good for,
Is to drink, dance and make lots of noise,
Marry many wives, have sex and make lots of babies.
Just look at yourselves,
You have brought to life our prophecy;
Ons het mos ges√™,
You cannot rule yourselves,
You are a symbol of poverty,
The bottom feeders of humanity,
Creatures of opportunity,
And like the rats that run riot in your townships,
You would rather step over each other to get to what you want,
Than work with each other to build towards what you need.
You are a disgrace of a race,
A lazy, mentally inferior peoples.
Allowing you to rule,
Is like letting the monkeys run the zoo,
Maar, julle is erge as di diere,
you rape your own young,
And abuse your own women.
Just look at what you have done to our once beautiful Johannesburg,
You have prostituted with her,
And now she stands as a squatter camp,
A refuge to pimps, drug lords and net my here weet.
She has become a waist land,
Even kak op sy straat bear witness to that.
Then you wonder why we didn't want you to procreate,
Your offspring; they are monsters like the seeds from which they fell,
Constantly high,
Just to try and forget that their mothers were prostitutes,
And their fathers drunkards.
You see,
You are only a tool to be used like a spade,
Useless without your master's guiding hand., But your leaders,
Julle luiers was studente van ons,
They have learnt well from the masters,
And now they themselves have become monsters,
The art of instilling fear they have mastered,
Having seen what we had done to Sophia-town,
They send in .úRed Ants.ù to tear your homes down,
And with these so-called .úMaberete.ù
They are slowly implementing a curfew now.
Then to soften you up,
They throw food parcels at your doors.
And remind you how they won freedom for you.
Places to educate; they will never build.
instead shebeens and churches pop up at every street and every neighbourhood.
They would rather keep you indoctrinated and intoxicated,
Unbeknown to them; They simply carry on our legacy.
Why should they invest in a nation of .úclever blacks.ù,
While you serve them well as their puppets.
Black pride my foot.
I am being sincere in saying,
This is no complaint,
Maar julle begin nou om julle selfs soos kafirs te dra."

"Selome Payne, better known as Poet Flow, is a writer and publisher from the coastal city, Port Elizabeth .ì now based in Johannesburg.
Her journey with poetry began at the tender age of 12, when she wrote her first poem based on a
painting called Two Moons, for 1996 talk show, Indwe. From then on, writing and storytelling became an
integral part of what defines her.Flow began publishing at the age of 18, then under the pseudonym, Kizee .ì short for her given Xhosa
name, Cikizwa. She further published in numerous anthologies including the Poetry Institute of Africa up until 2006.
In 2003, Flow ventured on to stage performance and found an even greater love for the arts through
Spoken Word and Hip Hop.With performances ranging from various Nelson Mandela Bay fundraisers and poetry and hip hop
events to the Grahamstown National Arts Festival, Flow has expanded her audiences from Street
Culture to corporate functions; sharing her thoughts across all media platforms. A key element in her
journey was the time spent as part of Eastern Cape record label, TrueSight Music.Since moving to Johannesburg in 2011, Flow established Poetree Publications. The company has
published 5 books thus far, including a collection of her own poetry called The Undelivered Score:
Letters from a poet's heart which was reviewed by the internationally acclaimed Rita Golden Gelman,
author of Tales of a Female Nomad. All publications can be purchased online from Amazon.com. Her
company focuses on giving a publishing platform to young and aspiring writers, as well as community
development through arts and literature. Flow is also co-curator of the fast-growing, annual
Eastern Cape Book Festival and has recently had a feature interview with Urban Tymes magazine in California.

higher power from which she draws all strength and energy. She lives by one simple philosophy: we are
greater than our biggest dream, and infinite are the capabilities of our minds.
",South Africa,"In-between, outside, within: there are coloUr lines.
A marvellous canvas, yet the outline: still black or white
divides.¶ , She blinks, wide-eyed, as she offers innocent smiles.
Her nods are so blatantly ignored.
She thinks of the why's, if it's her they despise-
This evident judgement she's never experienced
before.
Her new lease on life slowly fades as she tries
To win affection, acceptance; it's futile!
They care not, for they strive to further ostracize.
No amount of education would make her worthwhile.
For she is like blasphemy to a box-of-crayons
society!, In-between, outside, within: there are colour lines.
A marvellous canvas, yet the outline: still black or white
divides.¶ , He answers to a name; one which defames-
He is a stranger even to himself!
Eyes downcast in shame, humble he must remain;
Accepting food for his dignity and self-worth.
Persevering through heartache, he bears the pain;
Still dreams of a free moment!
Pride keeps him sane, he shifts no blame,
For every man must stand his own judgement.
But he is like blasphemy to a box-of-crayons
society!"

"Shabbir Banoobhai's poetry is spiritual, political and personal with the three themes interwoven, the personal poems often having a political dimension and the political, a spiritual. A child of parents who came to South Africa from India, he was born in Durban in 1949, where he lived for most of his life until he moved to Cape Town in 1995. He Of necessity he shared the fate of the larger black community of South Africans, his poetry reflecting that struggle. He qualified as a teacher in 1970, as a Chartered Accountant in 1978, and as a Chartered Management Accountant in 1983. Lectured at the University of Durban-Westville from mid 1977 to the end of 1982; ran a management consultancy practice in Durban from 1983 to 1995; and joined Old Mutual in Cape Town in January 1996.Retired in November 2005; and is now a full-time writer. Some of his works, in full, include: echoes of my other self; shadows of a sun-darkened land; inward moon outward sun; if i could write: Ramadan letters that can be read at Christmas or on any other day; and lyrics in paradise. He is the recipient of the Thomas Pringle Award for Poetry. What is particularly striking about his poetry is its complete sincerity, described as, .úa luminous work of the heart containing profound reflections on the nature of the Divine, Prophetic and human consciousness, love, justice, peace and war. A genuine and original Sufi primer for the 21st-century seeker, reflecting an important development in contemporary .òSouth African spiritual thought'.ù.",South Africa,"For mevlana jelaluddin rumi
Recalling a visit to his shrine in konya, you might have wondered as you heard me cry
when we met, how a seven-hundred-year-old grief
could live in a fifty-year-old heart, and thought no doubt
in that gentle day, fast-forwarding into night, that here
is an errant bird that has finally made it to its home, is a river at its source separate from the sea, i ask
the question, you say, reflects the answer you seek
when love answers love, joy replaces questions, i danced just there where you are standing now
and gathered in one shams-lit moment, such beauty
as only the one who loves knows is possible, that lives, as we live and shines with truth that lies within us:
so dance if you can, as one day you must; this madness
is all we have to show for the burdens we choose to lose
but first you need to stop your tears; they are affecting
the person behind you trying to take a photograph of love."

told her to quiet her tears

Lies on shaky ground
And won't seize to weep
Oh, Little Freedom hasn't found her feet
Little Freedom hasn't found her feet, Little Freedom lives inside him weak
Tries to find a way
To help him find his feet
Oh, Little Freedom lives inside him weak
Little Freedom lives inside him weak, She had a habit of singing heavens
When his ears were blocked
And dancing in poetry
Only when his eyes were closed
She who was once a gem
Is tarnished again in pain
She who was once a pearl
Is weakened once again
For her world was his
And his was hers
She lived his bliss
But somehow
He chose to curse her
For he knew not what she lived in
Or the sheer gift she was keeping
At a mere shift of perspective
She'd give all if he could let her
But instead
He up and left her
For he sought in her
What he knew of his world
Not knowing her spirit
Was drifted with birds
Now her skin still open
Her scars agape
Her hope in newborns
Has almost left
We thought the duty was ours
Now we're guessing again
Coz Little Freedom
Still hasn't found her feet
Still lies on shaky ground
And continues to weep
Little freedom hasn't found her feet
Lies on shaky ground
And won't seize to weep
Oh, Little Freedom hasn't found her feet
Little Freedom hasn't found her feet, She travels
Slow
On broken ropes
In dirty robes
Of stolen hopes
Her cries are deep
In silent screams
And
Beneath the wind
She hides her dreams
For
When time has come
She'll finally glide
She'll
Heal the scars
Fulfill the vows
Said to
Reveal the golden charms of life
Where she'll
Find a child in mind
Where she'll
Find a child in mind
For she resides in everyone, But for now Little Freedom
Lives inside us
Weak
Still looking for a way
To help us find our feet, Little Freedom lives inside them weak
Tries to find a way
To help them find their feet
Oh, Little Freedom hasn't found her feet

I manifested in the valley of the ancients,
god essence
East African gem.¶ nowhere else could they find the traces
Indigo rays reflected
From the life giver, night sinner, dreamer only by the day.
All that I chase turns to haze
Runs away
Tons of haze .òtil reality just turns to fade/blurry mirages of night and day/
Its hell on earth well lets set this dearth ablaze/I mean until its only just a fragment/Non .ì existent,
If time is .ì then no time is really wasted/ A chance to raise my next generation/
I call them blessings,
As I bask in the essence of life,
The stress are only lessons
Cause at my lowest point is when I was awakened."

In the All-Africa Museum of World Culture
Where, subject to strict temperature controls
The complete set of Stonehenge uprights is on display
In another room, a signed Folio of the renowned shaman, Shakespeare
And some Grimes Graves ancient arrowheads
Please mind your fingers as you pass. Refreshments are available
Along with souvenir replicas of the Mona Lisa (a recent purchase
made at smiling gunpoint)
The original cast of The Marriage of Figaro
Stuffed and tastefully mounted
Right next to the section showing
Admirable bits of admirals' rears
All contained, of course, within the European room. A room with
Medieval pedigree reaching back to the times of
True-Cross-Splinter collections and saints' worship-worthy knucklebones, Beyond this faintly rotting gathering of gods so dead
That sacrilege is no longer deemed to apply
A woman waits, burning her journals, and weeping like her mother did
For her gene-generations tell stories from other caves
Whispered on days of blessing and mourning
Sung over moving dunes under starlit skies
In forgotten tongues that only scorpions hear
And single-filing children seeing scimitars
Feel the dust-walls fall and dream of feelings
Those Victorians failed to crush in drabness, And having felt the power-pulse they move on
Confident that heaven alone archives what is true
Here, perhaps, new cathedrals of the senses
Collected collective celebrations
Will rise in sandstone dreamblocks and shine for all."

uMbulelo uyabulela, Translation, This poem is about the rare occurrence of love at first encounter. A city boy falls in love with a rural girl, and although from very different worlds their love flourishes. The poem is a celebration of the beauty of falling in love and how easily someone can go from being a stranger to a loved one."
"Sisonkepapu is a dynamic personality. Close observers of his work claim that he has a provocative poetic skill and has established himself as a prominent poetic voice within the Eastern Cape. Being a professor of literature, his focus extends beyond the academy and community, and has a penchant for critical engagement through writing and development of budding writers like himself. His poem was added into the syllabus for a Poetry course at NMMU in 2014 and 2015, and offered his insights into the critical revelation in the piece, and the art of poetic writing and literary interpretation in the Poetry lectures. The Resonance Poetry Movement, a poetry society he co-founded, facilitates creative writing workshops and has published an anthology, hosted local and International acts such as Ian Kamau and Luka Lesson. ",South Africa,".I dreamt of a world
with broken hearted men
whose pyramids have crumbled in
Penises severed like that of Osiris
and Isis
has fallen off the edge of the Earth
Their chests .ì wide open
And blood-gore
Like wounded prey
And they pray
.ì While carrying babies
on their backs
For guidance and strength
To mend their broken spirits
For the women whose necks
they have broken
Have emptied the calabash
swallowed the moon
And castrated their wombs.
No longer bound
by blood and nature
they have wrapped their doeks
around their heads
and carried the world in them
Searched for vast lands and fields
to plough a great plant
that is of their own choosing
The future has fallen
on the hands of children
whose skeletons are too weak
to carry their own malnourished bodies
Children of the night
only have darkness to play with
Dust clouds and cobwebs
Fill the room
where a mother's love
Is supposed to be
And so pain has been influential
In filling the gaps
of not having been breast-fed
And has erased
the one-sided conversations
we have had with
these drunk and broken-hearted men
because we are suns that set in noon
We have watched a thousand lonely sunsets
on desolate benches
waiting for you to come back to us
You, our mothers
And here I stand
With a spine dangling on the threads of fate
As I defy my fathers
We have succumbed enough of the phallic rule
What is the purpose of a antiwomen world?, All we have ever wanted
is a mother tongue-bed
to comfort us with psalms
lest we become
what we hate the most
I woke up
and I realised that
all rivers run in the same direction
hurry up, we are dying here!"

Don't get me wrong.
Not any ordinary brown,

Arrested by anomaly,
Those almost white legs on a black woman?
Hooogh!
Even you,
Wouldn't you want some of that almost, almost?, She's no dum dum.
She knows.¶.¶..
She wears short skirts,
Hoisted high,
Sits on bar stools,
Flawless caramel legs crossed,, When I go out with her,
I know I'm screwed,
Even dressed like a peacock,
Cleavage slipping down to my navel,
I won't get any male attention., Soon a gaggle of guys gathers,
I skulk,
The scented aroma of her high-pitched giggle
Wafts under my nose,
She knows how to play.
Now she's a white chick,
She laughs at jamaa's stale jokes., Meanwhile I sit darkly alone
Nurse my cool drink,
Pretend not to care."

This is a narrative poem about a woman that is being physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by her husband. The poem begins with an image of a young beautiful girl that is well raised and disciplined, who wishes for marriage and children. After some time her wishes are granted and she gets married and has children. But after some time, her husband becomes an angry beast that commits all sorts of abuse. The husband also infects her with HIV that he contracted due his infidelity. She dies a painful death at the hands of someone she once entrusted with her love and life. The poem is heartbreaking, but the poet uses it as a protest against abuse against women."

I fear my daughter will carry the weight of this society's agony
Cut from the same cloth as the old political repression and social segregation
If these are berries of my liberation
Then wake up all the freedom charter writers
And those heroes without names
Wake them up the cause of their deaths is unknown
There isn't enough land for my daughter to play
The space between her room and cell phone
Isn't enough for her childhood
She'll never get to have the world in her palms
Watch it twirl the way it did when we used to play itopo
She'll never get to create glue made of grass and sunlight just for fun
Or tuck her skirts in her panties without giving ideas of rape
In this society, she's a second class citizen because she's female
Sexually harassed
Working twice as hard to claim her rise
I work 8 hours a day
Leaving her in the supervision of the media
Whose lessons are more appealing than a mothers love
Fashion plays sexy dress up with her delicate figure
As if prostituting her worth to men with unmanaged hormones
For 16 hours she breeds herself
Feeds on dead TV content
In retrospect
When love was another reason for sunrise
Promising
Patient like my dreams are to my wobbly spirit
We had the best orgasms when we were virgins
Watching the stars whisper our future to the moon
Whiles our souls made love
I fear my little girl will never meet love's face
Or hear its whistling song in the street corner around sunset
Because love's fate is inside a used condom
And sometimes it comes with infections
That contaminate beds purified by vows
Introducing death that will make her head her parents household
Conviction will shadow her possibilities
Cause she might fall into bad testicles
And learn to raise a boy child alone
Then they'll call her names
Forgetting that this society is a home that fostered her
I am a mother
Trapped between the bible and the constitution
These Jurisdictions do nothing for my children's education"

Dis die mense, Voor die eiende
Bo die vraestel
Onder die tafel
In jou mond, Ek hoop jy kan my hoor
Want ek praat nie saggies
Ek praat met jou., Translation, In this poem the poet talks about a dream, and in this dream he asks his grandparents about the meaning of the word Afrikaans, what it signifies, and what it stands for, because he says people are calling him names and he is just a child with dreams therefore loves and appreciates everybody regardless of who they are or where they come from, and in the end he ends the poem by saying: Ek praat nie saggies ek praat met jou. (I'm not talking soft or silently I'm talking to you). He describes the dream being so soft like soap, father knocking on the front door, a girl singing and ends up saying he can't remember he was confused and believes Afrikaans is just a language like any other and we shouldn't criticise it or blame it because of past and history of South Africa."

off the edge of a mountain and slid
from his camping chair

uncoupling from the disbelief

resigned itself to calm
and floated for an instant in
green birdsong before the shadows
accelerated to gather him up far below, Onlookers came to view his slippage
over the flashed whiteness
before the heat softened
his terror to liquid, And some ventured
perilously close to the precipice
hoping to catch a glimpse of
his illegible form
stretched over the sharp black rocks, far below."

Apartheid ended in 1994.
That it had taken us 21 years to erase 4 centuries of violence.
How about that?
Isn't that wonderful? , See I don't know what country that man lives in,
But my country is built on bones
And we build towers for their tombstones
And pretend we never buried them., We like to pretend that our history is not one of violence
That we got the whole truth and were reconciled
Like black lives matter here
That the hangover was mild
That our soil didn't drink black blood like water
That most of it isn't still owned by a quarter of us
And like we are all free., We got kissed by freedom
And that was enough
To make us think we are drowning in it.
To make us think
Sharpeville never happened.
Blood River was a myth.
Magoo's disappeared overnight.
Isandlwana is just a word white people can't say right.
We didn't think that they just might happen again., See, my country was built on a grave.
And we dug them deep for the gold
And left behind the diggers
Always at the bottom of a hole
Because aren't they already coal?
To keep this country burning
To keep the wheels turning
To keep that freedom bus rolling
Where the price of admission
Is to burn black bodies alive
For profit., See my country is built on death and pain
Black graves for a foundation
Black bones for brick
Black blood for mortar
And black hands to build it.
Don't tell me all it took was a little summer rain
To make you forget."

sing a lot of choruses

And conclude with .úRest my soul.ù
There will be no viewing held, Everybody that came knows what I look like, When they carry the coffin to the grave
All those Old Nederdeutch Reformed
hymns may be sang
Like .úBe still and know.ù as well as
.úwill the circle ever be complete again.ù, But while the coffin drops and everybody throws rosepetals, Then Roy and Ninnes' mother,
Born, through her torn beaten lips, must
Sing Amazing Grace
All the verses
With her guitar, Everybody may cry softly and touch away tears, But no one must bawl, I dont want to
Lay ashamed in my grave
Because of all the inappropriate heaves of breaths
And hysterical yelling and
Unconcealed cries out of lungs, Make peace"

Would that make it more true?
Beat up, bruised up
Clots, streaks, scarred on my lap
On my skin fingerprints from a slap, Must I have fallen for some elaborate trap?
For me, he or she specifically set up, Must it be in some dark alley
Or it refuted verbally
Brutally forced on some stone cold ground
Hands on my neck chocking of all sound, Has it to be accompanied with physical pain
Or some soul wrenching disdain
Need I wince when I move cause I'm all sore
Must it be pictured as gore, Now I must not know what rape is
For when mine was not painful
Not violent far less cruel
Withdrawn not, far from broken
On my face no shame or sign of depression
I was told off, surely you must be mistaken, Mistaken?
If only the wall of my room for me they would have spoken , So I ask
Rape
What is rape, Is there some condition
A book full of instructions
When not met one oughta not mention
Far from it dare not cry rape, Rape
What is rape"

And my rugged suit

For we had to heard the cattle,
Since the cow's life is worthier,
Twin brothers in the kraal
Which can't be sold, than of hunger or sickness
The cattle for prestige
The prestige worthier than education
The education for the collar-jobs
The jobs against our customs, Look at me laugh:
For when I passed for secondary school
My father had a thousand cattle
Which I had to take care of
For he didn't have some money
For the school fees."

"Synik is a hiphop and spoken word artist from the vibrant streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. The lyrically dexterous MC is one of the most exciting young artists in Zimbabwe right now. Thriving on versatility, Synik switches easily from cleverly crafted soulful hiphop joints to hardhitting lyrical raps and spoken word pieces. A gifted rhyme .ì storyteller Synik is known for weaving words to create visual poetic pieces. The ever growing artist recently picked up guitar playing and has incorporated acoustic guitar to his performances. He prefers to use his close relationship with words to influence positive change and inspire people, seeking to .òwrite songs to right wrongs'. Affiliated with Zimbabwe's cultural activist movement, Synik understands that art should be used to address society's ills and he aims to do more than merely entertain with his work. Influenced a lot by conscious hiphop and neosoul music, the artists lyrics are mainly an expression of what the he encounters in life..úThe soul of Harare's conscious Hip Hop is in the safe hands of a small group of rappers. Among them is Synik who brings some positive and thoughtful messages at a time when just about every cheap African rapper is claiming a million haters and self-stamping themselves as .úKing of Swag.ù. (the peoples hub).While in high school a young Synik started putting his thoughts into raps in his school note books having been a fan of hiphop since he got introduced to the culture in his childhood. His high school had a large community of people who were also drawn to hiphop as an art-form. He was briefly part of Bulawayo based underground outfit, Encrypted Minds in 2001. The moniker is a remnant of this phase in his growth when he was influenced by hardcore underground hiphop. He started recording late 2003 in Harare, a period where he worked with the Phranchyze members Phlow and BC. His first release was an EP (The Beta Version 2008) which highlighted Synik's storytelling skills and lyrical prowess. The EP has been labelled a street classic by some and it earned Synik respect in Zimbabwe's hiphop community. He also released a single (God within/Find a way 2010) which revealed a more soulful Synik. He has featured on numerous projects including the African hip-hop mixtape 2, as well as collaborations with numerous Zimbabwean and African acts (Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya).His performing career developed when he got into Harare's lively spoken word/hiphop scene. He would soon become one of the most regular hiphop and spoken word performers at events such as Mashoko, The Circle, Chimoto Poetry Slams (Alliance Francaise), and the Acoustic Nights (Zimbabwe German Society). In 2010 as part of Poeticause he was involved in the Theatrical/ Poetry production 'Prisms' with fellow poets Blackpearl, Nebila, Flowchild and Aerosol. Some of his notable performances were at The 2010 Bulawayo edition of the Zimbabwe Social Forum, The One Day Hiphop Festival (Alliance Francaise), 2011 Independence Day Concert (with the hiphop band, the Monkeynuts), The Republic of Pungwe Launch and The Shoko International Hip Hop festival. If he is not on stage Synik can be easily spotted throwing rhymes in a cipher on Harare's streets.With a number of projects scheduled to come in the near future Synik is set to continue making waves in Zimbabwean hiphop and beyond.",Zimbabwe,"The awakening.¶I'm opening closed eyes
Hoping at the end of my days I can say that I chose wise
The media stays spinning tales like old wives, But when your goals seeking truth, inside is where the road lies
I'm starting with questioning, beliefs that I've held
Like happiness is only found through increasing your wealth
See it's the love for money that turns people to beasts
As long as war equals profits we aint seeing no peace
But I feel trapped, seeking freedoms like futility still
Coz I got to make cash to pay utility bills
It's unfair from the start how the way the board is set
A man will play by your rules if you trap him in debt
That means I'd take a job and get minimum wage
Just to pay, for some things that I don't need anyway
Consumerism is the prison and my people are caged
What fuels greed is the screen on which the image displays
Its brainwashing and they say it passively
Your life won't be complete without the latest gadgetry
Don't get me wrong, I aint saying that I don't like nice things
But a child's smile carries more joy than that ice brings
Aint no prosperity if nothing is left for posterity
Trying to find finite resources got them drafting war strategies
There's more tragedies going on ignored
Got me wondering, what I should use my poetry for
Advertising products and getting endorsed
Perpetuating misconceptions about my people of course
Too many times I got to defend this art as my own
But if its borrowed stories in my poems then I'm only a clone
I bring it home to the streets where the people are strong
And the situations drove many breadwinners from homes
Raising kids over the phone, with western union codes
While small bricks of lack of touch steady grew into walls
We are soul survivors, its true coz I feel it
Came out the wombs of queens with entrepreneurial spirits
But I'm not just Zimbabwean I'm a global citizen
My pen drips the stories of the world they got me living in
Using company bandwidth downloading revolutions
Jasmine to Wall Street we all searching for solutions
Pain is the bastard child when the planet is raped
As we await for recognition of the Palestine state
Ima find a cause that gives strength to my voice
With 7 billion books to read ignorance is a choice
When I was younger, I studied to acquire a paper
The University of Life gives a qualification that's greater
Like learning to love and showing creation respect
In each clay vessel something amazing is kept
I'm tracing the steps of those who sought a higher cause
Fought noble wars, and with the side effect of inspired souls
From the child who dreamt and became the leader who rose
To the small shaking voice that left evil exposed
To those who sought justice for every person
And in the face of mad oppression stayed fervently searching
For a truth that unifies instead of divides
It's you who decides whether you'll be remembered in life
By the stories you inspired, and the smiles that you midwifed
Eternity is going to be crafted by how you live life
Which is the reason why I am trying to awaken
Learning without ceasing, in season inspire a nation
Or just a single soul, their story may be greater than mine
But they may reach their destination, coz I stand as a sign
In my hands I only have the time I was given
But I am glad to say; now I am finally living
Finding a reason to stretch my imagination, shaping
My legacy, so my kids are content with the world that I gave them
So I am careful what I'm taking in, this world make you hate your skin
There's grace in every day you're in, this is my awakening
At you pace, it's not a race to win, so even when you face the wind
Find grace in very day you're in, may this be your awakening"

Its towering.¶ still a peeking glare

Hearer of all unknown secrets
Companion of the forgotten miseries
Bearer of my clan's insurmountable histories, Great history of culture, brave warriors and thunderous war songs
A gone past for which my heart still longs;
That beautiful heritage before the advent of the monks
And the tolling of their dongs
There, my identity belongs, That very spot of royal assemblage
Has lost its stand through time and age
It did bear the stool of the sage
But now the commoner's, our pinnacle of heritage
And that, the peak of my ancestors' rage!, The canopy of that tree has seen and heard many things, thus
The idle talk of commoners
The weary meditations of loners
The petty gossips of passing women
Quite oblivious of their lumps of burden
The anarchic revolts of warlords and followers
The merry yells and sounds of innocent children playing
The romantic refrains of budding lovers
Under the cover of twilight
And.¶.yes, I still remember.¶
.¶. So vividly
Under that silk cotton tree,
We.¶

Planted our solemn first kiss;
The onset of life's very bliss

from my childhood., I remember
.òTrou Dangereux'
where we would
challenge each other
to jump. , Close to the shore,
only twenty or more steps
past a ridge of volcanic rock,
there it lay,, swimming in tales of dead people and animals
and a monster sucking you into a bottomless pit.
The sea was murky there .î a sick grey-green colour.
We stood on black rock, salt-encrusted, sun-hot sacrifices,
hearts beating like captured birds' wings,
and with shaking legs
we jumped., No one ever reached the bottom. No one died., But I remember
pissing warmth into the cool current
curling between my toes,
imagining fingers pulling,
swimming as fast as I could
back to the edge .î, and when scrambling up the precipice's wall
the worst was feeling slick seaweed cloy my limbs,
and the rocks' broken barnacles clawed my skin
in a vicious attempt to make me cry
in front of my friends., Once back on dry land,
the pulse of the ocean continued to drum in my ears
like a huge shell swallowing me alive,
but I laughed and smiled along with the others
knowing I had faced something deep down there,
an inexplicable dangerous hole
that would keep gaping at me , on and on, like the tides
and the cycles of the moon,
always there
below every path I walk, waiting.
-Tania van Schalkwyk:Hyphen, UCT Writers Series 2009, Notes, Abyss, Poem inspired by an article in the Argus, particularly this extract:, Deepest seabed unveils its secrets
A team of Japanese and British marine biologists found that delicate, soft-walled creatures dominate the microbial life forms that inhabit the sediment at the bottom of a deepwater trench in the Pacific Ocean. The trench, called Challenger Deep, lies 643 km off the Marianas Island in the South Pacific. The trench is 11.2 km below the sea surface at its deepest point and would comfortably submerge Mount Everest in a 1.6 km-deep layer of water.

I used to make apologies for having the soft in my man.
A wave of woman in my masculinity.
I was called too gentle and too unmanly for not hoarding women in my waist.
Today I wear my mother in my voice,
I am clothed in her.
I wear my sisters in my thinking, my grandmother in my bone, in my soul.
I am after all my grandmother's child.
For she prayed for me.
It was she who went before God,
red war paint on her face from fighting the men.
She pleaded for a son.
How then can I deny the woman in me,
when my coming to earth was because women prayed for me?
Was I not made from a woman's mouth?
Only father remarks at my petal nature,
The women I come from say I am beautiful., You are Oceanic
All she wanted
was to find a place to stretch her bones.
A place to lengthen her smiles
and spread her hair.
A place where her legs could walk
without cutting and bruising.
A place unchained.
She was born out of ocean breath.
I reminded her;
.òStop pouring so much of yourself
into hearts that have no room
for themselves.
Do not thin yourself.
Be vast.
You do not bring the ocean to a river'."

Her beaten regions swell,
On my land they plan bullet shells,
Grow violent spells, then harvest the smell of burnt flesh and gunpowder.
The Black sweat the sun devours
The Cross hung from Ivory towers, empowers the clergy and me.
Making me wonder
Does the All Seeing Eye Cry?
At the sight of Grannies pushing trolleys, collecting cans so her children can eat some fish out of can.
The difference is so significant when others can
Eat sushi from each other's ligaments.
Does the All Seeing Eye shed tears?
For the dead peers we accompany in coffins, too often.
To soften the blows we roll, it seems down a steep hill.
Thread the truth through the Eye of a needle the sow back together my people.

over the lombardy poplars

threading their hanging gardens

for the lion
to swallow the sun, in the heat haze i see the garden
that could be
each fork full a burden
and a blessing
if i dig deep i touch the black marrow
the original clay of this valley
i think we all have our own fields to dig
the kind of field
no gardener can dig for you
our own beds to make
to lie in
no maid can straighten, a new south african flag is flying
over the weeping willows
above our village
there is no moon
orange butterflies dance
around the blue skirts of the dams
as the old strawberry plants lie discarded
in the dust        	, as the caves cup the air

to the sounds of our names
to the hadedas passing overhead

Crooked, fractured, broken stories about how life leaves them empty
And her, full with their scent.
They kiss her tongue blue, burning her mouth with lust
Tasting her silent voice, muting it further.
Between her thighs there lies a home
For men that seek to forget their faces for a while.
And under their bodies, she has learned how to forget her name.
Sometimes, she is multi colored
Blood tinging her skin, bruised, like an old memory
She likes clouds.
How they gather darkly yet produce something as beautiful as rain.
She says some pain gathers itself and makes you survive.
When the weight of unfamiliar bodies press against her body
She looks outside the window
And remembers why clouds gather., When she gets home, with plastics full of food and clothes
The smiles of her children revive her.
She no longer feels hollow.
She remembers her name, her place
And how her love for her children has no shade of pain.
Their bellies filled, their gleaming eyes
That is her story.
Not the brokenness of men or their scents.
Her body, a double voice,
Lingers between two lives.
But she is never empty like those men.
She knows herself.
Mother."

",Botswana,"Like ripples
When water is troubled
There are signs of the struggle
Like the sound of rustling as the wind blows through leaves,
There are signs of the struggle
Like heat on the forehead
When a fever rages
There are signs of the struggle.
And some struggle more than others.
Ripple more, rustle more, burn more., The pages felt like a formless landscape
An endless expanse of ideascape
To escape this cape of humanity that cages the god in him.
A place where he
Forms and unforms,
Builds and destroys
In the beginning those
Pages were his earth
Formless and void
And with every word he breathed life
On to dead pages
Dividing light and dark
Earth and sky
Land and sea
Night and day, Till the white was clothed
In a lush metaphorical green,
Reaching skywards
As though trying to bring
Down a piece of heaven,
Through pages
On an earth where hell rages, But there are signs of the struggle,
Unable to escape his cape,
Shards of humanity pierce the God in him
Causing the cause off course
And suddenly he who forms and unforms deforms
Leaving twilights between light and dark
Pillars of earth invading the sky
Uncertain if their genesis
Land is the seas nemesis
The lush metaphorical greens
Metamophose
into rainbows of hurt and sorrow,
Paradise doesn't rain,
But his poured endless showers
As if trying to wash away the signs
And return to white pages
On an earth where hell rages
But u know as well as I do,
The struggle continues.¶, And there are signs of the struggle.
Like coffee stains on table tops
When work spills over hours
Like Darker than black skid marks
On the road to collision
When the brakes are not enough.
Like frowns on faces
When joy and sorrow
Switch places, The more he wrote
The harder it became
It was as if heaven
Was alive with malice
The closer he got
The further it ran
Reaching for something
Unattainable all he could get
On his pages was blurred images.
Of what could have been perfection
If you could see right
Or if he could rewrite
But life is seldom so kind
Some scenes you can't unwrite
And most sentences you can't unspeak
He battled with the pages
Pen in hand
Struggling to keep
His world pure
But words
Often without remorse
Relentlessly haunt the speaker
And Spoken to
Speaking that hidden power into situations
And even as he picked up the 9th pen
to write for the 100th time
on 71st piece of fresh paper
There were signs of the struggle.¶, Like the way his hand kept shaking
As if overcome by the sudden
Desire to write something other
What was currently being written
There were signs of struggle
Like the labored breathing
Heavy, difficult breaths as though suppressing
Urges seditious to the current endeavour
Hardly intelligeble handwritting
As fingers choked rebelious the pen into
Spitting out what ink it had,
Into words.
he wrote, sometimes retracing as if to add more meaning,
Yet the more he wrote,
The less meaning  it seemed to have,
Like scribbles on paper.
But that was only a sign of the struggle.¶
His words spoke in threes, Dear *leizel*
{Let the be light}
Bull shit!"

One word, one aim, one destiny
Poetavango spoken word poetry, Translation:
Songs of the wordsmiths
Songs that are neither here nor there
Songs without lyrics
Songs that you need to meditate upon because they need concentration
They call them songs of the wordsmiths
Let us stand and dance to the songs of the wordsmiths
Songs without lyrics
Songs that are neither here nor there
Songs that you hear in another realm
And touch the bottom of my heart and make it pure
They call them songs of the wordsmiths
They once assembled and took us to a place where we found a regiment of men and women dancing to the song
To the songs of the wordsmiths
And while we were relaxing, there oozed a melody from afar
And assembled people
Men and women burst out and we danced to the songs of the wordsmiths
Songs of the wordsmith
The assembled crowd were met by a tall figure
A tall man indeed
And the words were that the word has grown
The stage cannot accept owners
As for me God has given me my own chance since I am steadfast in prayer
Songs of the wordsmiths
The assembled crowds have responded by saying
Yes they need assistance with words, however I will request that
My people give me some comfort after judgement
And those were the words by Morongwa-a-Matsau
He who had already pronounced that wealth has come
And as a result chiefs are at war
But I will make a request, a plea that my people console me after judgement
So that I also become pure in soul like a peacock though this would be against the wish of my enemies
Let there be one word, we are going to one destiny, the vision should be one
One word, one aim, one destiny

"The name, Tshepo Molefe. Also known as Blackhole on stage. This pseudo name is a reflection of who and what I am, from my short nature (which I inherited from my mother) to the anger that I bring on stage and the hatred I am still trying to extinguish with my pen.I write to change perceptions and hopefully to inspire change in a person's life and view on things such as love, what poetry is and the misconception of man being invulnerable. I feel like as poets, it's our duty to not only just write to be dope or to compete, but we need to touch life with our craft and build a better society through our wordsmith. That is what my art aims to do, and one day will.
",South Africa,"I hate your misdeeds, Aphrodite
I curse your name from here to infinity
I loathe how your creation creates misery
Turmoil within this temporal vessel, Muggles, beware!
The cupid's arrows are laced with infatuation
So when it strikes your loving organ
You will see mirages of a happily-ever-after
That will soon be a Never-ever-after, There is no art in how daggered hearts crumble
Nor the death of shattered souls being viewed by loved ones
Mourning cascades crooning an obituary
.úHere lies a fool beckoned by Aphrodite.ù
How much longer must we endure your crimes
Before you pay for your sins
Or are Gods too holy to atone for their darkness , And when love comes kneeling in desperation
Seeking for an invitation in your life
Please ask her.¶
Please ask her.¶
Ask her, where did she bury Romeo's body
Ask her if Juliet had fun following in his footsteps
Ask her if .òCrazy in Love' was playing in the playground when Othello choked the life out of his beloved
Please ask her whether Gatsby's fated fatal bullet wound burnt out of Daisy's fondness, See, Love has never been kind to foolish souls, soldiers
For too many times we have died on her battlefield
Words of your friends act as feathers of Osiris
Reviving orphaned feelings only for them to be slaughtered
Again.
There is no joy in this venture
So, stop being a martyr of a lost cause
Disciple of a twisted belief, And please
For the love of God, please.
Don't liken love with God
For love is a religion
And I ain't a believer
So forgive me for hesitating to step into church, Sometimes, you just got to accept some facts.
Love was never meant for muggles like me
I'm too hollow to follow the broken beat of this organ
I beg of you
Plead with you
Donate the scarred remains of what used to be my heart
To a dead carcass nearby
It has more use for it than I
Purge its meanings from my existence
So, when my supposed wife comes knocking at my door, Tell her my spirit is vacant
Whenever she tries to call me her soul mate"
"The poet, performer, actress, presenter and producer Lebogang Mashile, the daughter of exiled South Africans, was born in the U.S. in 1979. At the age of sixteen years she and her parents returned to their home country. It was while she was studying law and international relations at Wits University in Johannesburg that the desire to work as an artist took hold of her. In her work as a life skills facilitator for adolescents √± focusing on topics like gender issues, teamwork and sexuality √± poetry has been her preferred medium. Mashile regards its expressive power as the most effective tool to bring about those changes in mental attitude that are needed in the aftermath of the socio-political changes in post-apartheid South Africa. .úThe enemy isn√≠t really clear in the way it was before. It's an incredibly sensitive, complicated struggle with many dimensions, but the site for that struggle is inside. .¶ The language of poetry comes from a place where that transformation has to begin, that sort of intuitive, creative, spiritual searching place that will be the fuel for any kind of transformation process..ùMashile began to achieve recognition as one of South Africa's most popular young artists in 2002 when she performed her hip-hop inspired poetry at the Urban Voices Spoken Word and Music Festival to a large audience. She was the presenter and producer of the television programme L'Atitude, a concept that she co-executive produced with Curious Pictures. Throughout its three seasons and seventy-eight episodes she introduced the viewers to the personal stories of a diverse cross section of South Africans and their relationships with their immediate surroundings. These insights were gained from her travels through South Africa. The series reached an audience of over two million households.Her lyrical and gutsy poems in the collection A Ribbon of Rhythm (2005) also speak about life in the new South Africa. Issues such as the diversity and unity of the .úRainbow Nation.ù, the status of women, violence and the fragility of individuals are all treated with a sense of urgency, humour and at times with melancholy and a certain rawness. Mashile's self-produced album Lebo Mashile Live! combines her performance poetry with hip-hop, house and R & B.In June of 2008, Mashile published her second anthology entitled Flying Above the Sky. This collection marks the poet's first foray into self-publishing. In October of 2008, Mashile wrote and performed in a cross-media and cross-generational collaboration with renowned choreographer Sylvia Glasser entitled Threads. One can find Mashile's thoughts in her monthly column, In Her Shoes, which she writes for True Love magazine. She can currently be seen on South African television screens as the presenter of Drawing the Line, a game show on SABC2 dealing with moral issues. The show is now in its second season.In 2006 she was awarded the prestigious Noma Award for Publishing in Africa, the premier prize for African literature. The Jury characterised her poetry as of .úa distinct oral flavour, developing oral poetry and performance beyond the boundaries of the poetry of the era of resistance.ù. In 2007, she was the recipient of the City Press/ Rapport Woman of Prestige Award. Mashile lives in Johannesburg.",South Africa,"I can no longer keep count of the women you put inside of me
They are white noise on a black screen
Familiar tastes on a foreign tongue
Unknown memories resting firmly in the lap of my brain
Sometimes I am them
I wonder if they suddenly dream of elephants
Laugh in colour
And carry rivers in their hearts
Remembering when the whole world changed colour
And they did not know you anymore"
"The work of Breyten Breytenbach includes numerous volumes of poetry, novels, and essays, many of which are in Afrikaans, many translated from Afrikaans to English, and many published originally in English. In 2000, Breytenbach published <strong>Lady One: Of Love and Other Poems</strong>, a collection of poems for his wife that includes images of east Asia, southern Africa, and Morocco. The combination of the personal and the global in the poems reflects a marriage that, because it was considered taboo under South African apartheid laws, led to the poet's original exile.Known as the finest living poet of the Afrikaans language, Professor Breytenbach's verse volumes include <strong>The Iron Cow Must Sweat</strong> (1964) and  (1976) and they feature rich visuals, a powerful use of metaphor, and a complex blending of references from Buddhism, Afrikaans idiomatic speech, and recollections of the South African landscape. He has been honored with numerous literary and art awards, including the APB Prize, CAN Award (five times) Allan Paton Award for Literature, Rapport Prize, Hertzog Prize, Reina Prinsen-Geerling Prize, Van der Hoogt Prize, Jan Campert Award and Jacobus van Looy Prize for Literature and Art.",South Africa,"Right at the beginning
when we were still slim
with answers as white as teeth and supple eyes,
and you innocent,
and my desire a snake mousing for your wrinkled nut .ì
right then and there I wanted to write you a poem, At the time the days were unthinking
and nights long enough to dream
Time was for ever.
I scrabbled a spray of broad outlines on an envelope
as ever at the outset
the shadows of one hand's displacements, I wanted to mark you with crosses
the way one flips a coin in the air
to conjecture the future,
play your body like a fresh instrument
unfolding under my fingers
to shudderingly sing of discovery's joys.
Thus, more or less, were the trails of the verse, which I could not knot to stanzas of sound.
And we lived, we travelled,
we bottled the seasons, explored the slits:
I squandered the dark dimensions, My errings put to sea:
the envelope as unwritten letter
sailed from one land to the other
from hand to hand.
Sometimes with a sudden dove of thrashing
in the throat
I discovered it again in a box of old papers
in the dark windfilled loft of an evacuated house
and I tried to remember, what it was I would have liked to write
right at the beginning
when we were still lithe
with white-toothed answers and a supple eye, But the handmap had become
the pale membrane of a testament
scribbled in blotting language,
indecipherable like the snakeskin
no longer able to unknot
the deployment and pleating of desire
or to invent the whole, Now when my end is rising over the horizon
with bleached sails .ì
a first and last island
where only the blind dog waits in faith
I fold this writing in two, woman,
and lay it, hidden in the envelope
of a lost beginning,
like an unavailable homecoming
at your door"
"The work of Paarl born poet and publicist, Loftus Marais is visual and ironic, rebelling against a traditional Afrikaans poetry, while also acknowledging the handed-down Afrikaans belief in the poet as craftsman, in the importance of formal, structural and musical elements. This makes his poetry a complex modulation of a voice that is both lyrical and bitter, sombre and comical, nostalgic and ultra-contemporary. After being published in several anthologies, his debut collection of poems, Staan in die algemeen nader aan vensters, was published to high acclaim.",South Africa,"Op .òn vlakte buite Malmesbury,

Dingezweni is a Xhosa name/term given to people who lack direction and (or) do not fit in society. This poem speaks about people who drift around suffering because they are searching for a life where they don't have to work hard. The subject of the poem is painted as a spoilt child who has never had any hard discipline and is a Dingezweni as a result- searching for a world where all he/she will hear is .úYES.ù. The last stanza is a plea to parents not to withhold discipline from their children and for people to strive to be better."
"There are days when Letang Selepe wakes up feeling like a ripe and wise 50 year old, and other days a scared and confused 16 year old girl. She is actually a 28 year old Tswana woman, from a small village called Ramokgonami. She spent most of her pre high school years in a small mining town called Selebi-Phikwe. Lived in Zimbabwe for a good 4 years, and dwelled in Francistown and Gaborone thereafter. Lived in the USA for a magical year, where she met amazing people from all over the world. She came back home, yearning to write again. She currently resides in Maun, and it is here where she stopped caging in her emotions and let them roam free on paper.Poetry captivates you, in the now, it move's you between different worlds. It is for this reason that she was drawn to writing, poetry was a path to healing, a path to acceptance. Most of her poetry stems from her own reality.

Of songs unwritten,
Our bodies
Moving side by side
To a rhythm set millions
Of years ago, Hearing Echoes of
A past long buried
Creatures long gone
Never to roam again
Seeing glimpses of a future
Bleak at best,
Temperatures rising
Populations of fauna
Dropping to depressing lows, We look on.¶., Hiding behind the
Masks we created to
Hide unshed tears
At a world we have filled
With more calamities
Than happiness , A world covered in smog
Smog so dense, we can barely see the stars
From our very own porches, Wonder what would be if
Smartypantsyphones
And electronic tablets
Shut down
And we were
Yanked by the nape of our necks
From the comforts of our very own sofa's
And mother nature tore our eyelids  from our very eyes., So with unblinking eyes
We are forced to watch as
The place we call home
Disintegrates, under our very care, Temperatures rising
Until the scorching heat
Burns our skins off.
Vultures yanking our tongues out
In vengeance for all the harm
We've thrust upon them, Unable to scream, Silently watching
As carnivores of all shapes
And sizes
Feed off our very feet
So we cannot outrun
The sewer rats as they
Feed off our very limbs
For all the times
We could not let them be, Our remains finished of
By our own kind
A fellow human being
like you and i
All because they have no
meals to feed upon.¶, Afterwards putting on the very same masks
We wore, when we thought we had it,
all under control, pretending to care
Yet never caring enough.¶
to protect that which we could, So,
 So long as the globe keeps spinning
They too will sway to unwritten songs
Of ages gone by.¶
Until the end
When all shall cease
Sadly,
with none.¶.. at peace"

The novel Upon This Mountain (1989) tells the story of Mwambu, who is determined to touch heaven, and describes his journey towards adulthood. The novel combines African folklore and proverbs with Christian symbolism. Its main theme is that of growing up in the Ugandan society and what challenges come with growing up in the traditional setting.Wangusa was chairman of Uganda Writers Association and founder president of International PEN Uganda Centre.",Uganda,"My kinsmen, where have the mushrooms gone?
Where have all the mushrooms gone?
That sprouted in homestead and everywhere?, My kinsmen, where have the all mushrooms gone?, Lunkonakhisi  that was the chief of all mushrooms
So broad was its canopy the wild goat often slept under it, Namutuyu, or tuyutuyu, of a red-brown hue
That shot up in battalions and squeezed together
As though in competition to exit the soil, Kamelele that prominently resembled the ears of the bat
And shivered upon sodden tree trunks in the jungle, Namataala that germinated in precincts of the kraal
Where animals had sweetened the soil with their dung, Nasiina that often was found upon the dunghill
Where the cattle dung had lost its heat
Mixed with refuse and converted into deep dark soil, Namasisye that sprung up in the field on spots of cowpat
That had disintegrated and sunk into soil, Nabitsikhi that happened upon random tree strumps
On the hillside just as in the plains, Bureesi that grew around the exalted rireesi anthill
In seasonal rhythm with the anthill√ïs termites, Bumesi that thrived in the mountain chill
And whose soup was of sweetest flavour on earth!, Burunda of a light-brown hue that resembled
The sirunda anthill about which they raised their heads, Bumukele the smallest of mushrooms
White as cattle egrets, that materialized in myriads
And that you relished to the back of your head!
Namakhoosi  that emerged beside the trodden footpath
As though anxious to be the first that you sighted
Bukulumbuli that germinated upon the rolls of grass
Containing dregs of banana juice extract
That were thrown away into the banana garden, Bukendaani that came into your view any place
As though sympathetic to the poor that had no sauce, Bukusuma that had a fat navel like a rare damsel,
That appeared in twos, threes and fours
And their flesh felt so thick in your excited hand, Bulyasa of a white-black hue like bukusuma
Yet, unlike them, having no navel
And rose one at a time like a mother√ïs only child, Namafura that had a glossy skin
And exuded oil like meet sizzling before the fire, Nabakooko the mushroom with a radiant aura
Like a virgin with tattoos on face and belly, Bungulumisye over which you threw a stick
And they panicked, ran and clang to each other!, To all those mushrooms must you add luisiri,
Whose slender and tall stalk you dropped down
Some yawning channel of rireesi anthill;
The ants dragged it to their procreation center:
The constant seasons did their rhythmic rounds
From one rainy peak to the next rainy peak
The one random morning you stumbled upon
Buisiri mushrooms besieging the entire anthill
And you gasped in ecstatic wonderment!, My kinsmen, again I asked and you answer me
Where have all those mushrooms gone?"

 reeking of his absence., Mum took to knitting on Mondays,
Bible study on Tuesdays and on all the

at times refracting her loneliness., In this land, he could leave.
Her dark hue was no longer beautiful
the weight of her love was breaking his back.

Fella's blues?, Over the static line her sisters pray, curse,
dissect his reasoning, repeat in three different

She lives in Maputo, Mozambique, after living in Johannesburg for most of her adolescence and early adulthood.Her day job is with rural civil society movements, in an attempt to raise consciousness and provide skills for political participation, monitoring of state budgets and quality of social services.

running through the guts of the forests
demanding an independence that is only for
aspiring black bourgeoisie

mercilessly dividing every piece of golden land
and forests, hostage of their precious wood
and seas of crustaceans, and networks .¶
networks .¶and shark net works
islets and heavens
you set these on your table, as succulent appetizers
but coming from the dust of the ghetto
the voice that for 500 years complains, is singing:, I just wished you could care a little about me, Nightmare 2:, you, your offspring and parasites, diving
with bloody hands in the banquet
result of the carnage of spirits of a people
while it outside your palace
the corn is dry and the drum is dumb
plays only a pandza1
that helps celebrate
the misery of consciousness, blindness of the mind
but, from the sea breeze, that anguished voice comes closer:, I just wished you could care a little about me, Nightmare 3:, You are a bogeyman, walk with
xipanha-uswa  shoes, hoarding
all that is in your way
swallowing from every orifice of your body
bridges, rivers, national dams and multinationals
I see you fat and smelly, oblivious
to the vibrations of the lava drenched with tears
tears of these people consumed by ignorance
and complacence, Dream 2:, I dream you again, taken by the curse
of suffering spirits
ghosts tear your meat in fillet for dogs
ghosts perform obstetrics in your bowels
rip a kidney, rip a liver, lungs implode
and finally, tractor tires on your solar plexus
matches and
BOOM!

I totally disagree
Before you overrule you have to listen to me
Prosecuting council is mistaken
In fact they have got it all twisted,
How could they even suggest that this whole universe began with a BIG BANG?
Or that we the species that built the pyramids developed through evolution
It is evident that Prosecuting Council's brain is doing revolutions
Inside their cranium
And their case is based on nothing but pure delirium
So please hear my case.¶
Everything that exists implies the existence of a Creator
Let me put it to the court that there is a God in the heavens
He alone has all power
He is not bound by time and His existence transcends forever
His artistic excellence makes Picasso look like a two year old with crayon
He does not need canvas to paint on
He paints sunrise and sunset on each end of this world
Crimson and oranges on backgrounds of fading blue
The whole colour-blocking thing didn't start with me and you
God's attention to detail is outspoken
Just look at how He made you
Anatomy and physiology met when He breathed into a lump of dust
Cartilage and muscle, ligaments and nerves
The precision of this machine just leaves me unnerved
This God made pupils to dilate
Hearts to beat
He made those feet that tap-dance in the street
Hands that hold, fold into fists
Fingers that wrap around pens and transcribe these lyrics
The whole symphony of creation just screams that God exists
And honestly your honour
How else would one explain the earth rotating about its axis
From west to east
Each and every day and at the same speed
God's greatness is revealed
In every atom, every element, every compound on this earth
In every radio-active emission and every new day's birth
Any time anything living breathes in testifies the presence of a Creator
And most of all your Honour
The presence of God is revealed through the dynamics of our humanity
Through our own creativity
Through our music and our poetry, our dance, our graffiti
Let me rest my case on the base
God is revealed through you and through me"

Invited even thunder to her beck and call
Her breath commanded the mighty hawks,
Warhogs and eagles.
Her trance like war dance
amazingly soulful, From the mighty Queen Nzinga
A sharp insular spark of energy
glowed eternally
Her ocean wide mind
her vibrant laughter
contained the wisdom of a million books
Her toes scratched the earth with pride,
She was a friend of the moon
and a friend to the tiniest of insects, Trees grinned and flowers glowed
in her hallowed presence
A tested friend of life
Her healing hand amended God's mistakes
And comforted life's orphans
Her generous mind fed millions of earnest hopes
and potent dreams"

To call to come if not
On the street
So soon to stones, Only to reap in return
A whirl wind of white fear
Handing out shovels
To pit open the earth, Are these lucky ones
The comrades of yesterday
Dying in no different direction
Burial is a state function, And all can attend
The dead are not excluded
The not too alive
For a feel of what to come, And the rest of freedom
Is an erected monument
Of remembrance
No more raging blood of more songs, The old songs of freedom
Are no longer audible
They have petered out of the heart
For new songs from across the ocean, Where the birthday
Of one man is how much
The available freedom
And then only for who can buy"

over our city like a blue hue,
beckons
in the molasses folds of midnight

softens the folds of my ears
and the south-easter
sings in b-flat
as it winds through my empty heart, Ma,

and the tears roll down my cheeks
like rocks
and pull the breath from my lungs
i have walked through the skin
on the soles of my feet
winding through another country's streets
another people's pain
I miss
the sea
and the smell of salt
that finds its way to our front door
on summer morning's
swollen with heat
I miss the voices and words
of my people
and the way their tongues
hold words in their mouths: flat and rough then sometimes flat
and smooth
the blood in my veins
beats to a rhythm
I cannot find in this green land, Ma,
I'm coming home
that mountain towering
over our city like a blue hue,
beckons
in the molasses folds of midnight

softens the folds of my ears
and the south-easter
sings in b-flat
as it winds through my empty heart, Ma,
I'm coming home
it's time to leave the world behind
now it's you who
I want to lay
beside"

Also the Bali, flicking his tail as the last clouds in the world dissolved at his back. And the Caspian, with his famous winter mane, has lain down finally for good. Or so we believe. And so I imagine you must be even more alone now,, The only heat of your kind for miles.  A solitary country.   At dawn, you listen past the birds rutting the trees, past even the fish at their mischief. You listen the way a woman listens to the apparatus of her body.  And it reaches you, my own wish, like a scent, a rag on the wind. It will do no good to coax you back, From that heaven of leaves, of cool earth and nothing to fear.  How far. How lush your bed.  How heavy your prey.   Day arrives.  You gorge, sleep, wade the stream.  Night kneels at your feet like a gypsy glistening with jewels. You raise your head and the great mouth yawns.  You swallow the light."

Complexities are simplicities compounded
Layered reasons, paper-thin,
Folded into reams,
Stacked on top of each other
A billion simplicities
Interconnected and throbbing
To know one is to glimpse all
To gaze down the marrow chamber of its spine, Fate's Music
Fate plays all of us to a tune we don't know
Thou at times we dance to its beat
But who prey tell is the conductor
Is it us with our dreams
And songs in our heads
Or does destiny make
The music that moves us
Are we improvising
Or is it written
I would wager both are on stage
That we are at our best when in harmony
Only these things are certain
We are not alone in this orchestra
We all have our diminuendos and crescendos
We all lend our strains to the symphony
And the curtain falls on us all, Through darkness
How deep was the darkness that enveloped me
And for years of youth was all to see
How much hurt and scorn can a boy take
And what kind of man do they make, Yet all the innocence lost, never to return
Set a blaze in me a fire to learn, Once it drove me to be the best
Now I lay that ghost to rest
I have nothing to prove,
My life has shown
Out of the dirt an oak has grown, Though at times afraid
I shan't yield to the frightening
The darker the clouds
The brighter the lightening, Should the darkness impinge once more
It will find me as it did before"

A child will come to understand the meaning in their name
A tribe will retrace their pathway to the beginning of their totem
A people might preserve their culture for tomorrow's generations
A simple prophecy in graffiti on a city wall some rock paintings
In a song book a poet might begin an existence
Injustice will begin to see his nemesis in the distance
The simplest words might inspire a mother's strength for her children
When love and laughter are prescribed for a family as their medicine
Planets in rotation in a cypher will write life a hook
Didn√≠t Ayi Kwei preserve our history in the pages of unpublished books?
Matigari told of the wisdom alive in ones reading of the modern stars
The tales of freedom in this hunger that houses burning butterflies
Bantu liked our beauty and consciousness in the depth of apartheid
Oa Magogodi mic√≠d it in our first language, spoken word
We recite it on stages and pages upon which the unspoken will be heard
If in the beginning was the word, then someone must have understood that with a pen
A lonely heart will dwell in remembrance, the beauty of life with a loved one
A politician will authorize the massacre of protestors taking a father from a daughter and son
A starved soul will protest silently against that which has made him weak
A writer will alter the language a people's consciousness speaks
An oppressive system will draw up title deeds depriving people of their ancestral home
I will write all night to inspire you and go back home all alone
An officer will incarcerate a man that refuses to bribe him and
A sick mind will stab to death another life with a pen
An artist will dwell in solitude with a pen
Politicians will steal many ballot boxes with a pen
Voices will not be silenced by violence with a pen
Ideas won√≠t die unseen
Recorded for tomorrow with a pen
Retrieved from yesterday with a pen
Yet today some will be too afraid to hold a pen in their hand"

"Unathi Slasha under the nom de plume .òDark-blood the bard' is a spoken word artist, performer, literature enthusiast, poet, short story writer born in 1989, emerging from a small township named Dispatch in the Nelson Mandela Bay, infamous of its extremely high rate of illiteracy and dearth of artistic activism. A glimmer of hope carried out by this well-read young man determined to be a positive model and a trendsetter among his peers and set a perfect example for the up-and-coming young people in his community through performance art, with an undisputed aptitude.
His love for performance poetry commenced when he got introduced to poetry sessions by a friend who was a poet. From there, he got influenced and imbued with passion to start writing. He consistently contains an influential and enticing manipulation of words, with a flawless poetry and a unique phraseology and diction. On stage he is known for his spirited and energetic delivery and controversial style that comes out as a blend of street style yet literary poetry that involves socio political issues and historic events that tend to take any audience aback.His love for African literature is evidenced by the allusions and complex metaphors and intertextuality prevalent in most of his poetry .ì spoken word.
He aims at using his writings as an apparatus to inform and to instigate social reforms: to individuals who wish to be products of change in the society at large: he creates a personal pressure that frog-march them to do research about their identities and roots. Since he commenced his journey of performances and circulation around the different parts of the Eastern Cape, KZN and in the Western Cape, he has been receiving respect and love from each and every single person that has witnessed his pure talent and energy on stage.
One of his short stories and a few of his analytical poems have been published in an annual literary Journal called Ntinga, and as well as in the publication called Expressions within both of these publications were/are initiatives of arts and culture and the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University's department of language and literature. During the operation of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, when some of the matches where held in PE, he was one of the performers that kept the crowd intrigued with his revolutionary and unconventional poetry at the PE Opera House theatre.
He has performed in East London at one of the most prominent platforms known as the Soul Clap Sessions organized and hosted by Ipoetry KaNkqo. The Bard was one of the indelible artists that had an outstanding theatrical performance at the annual Grassroots Arts Festival held in Motherwell. He was one of the four first PE artists to make an appearance in the yearly Hip-hop event .ì The Final Touchdown in Alice. The bard has performed as a guest poet at the Love Life Music is Life mini Festival that was held In Uitenhage at Willow Dam in 2013. In 2012 he was one of the poets that were chosen to facilitate and demonstrate spoken word to high school pupils during the poetry workshops that were held in September during the National Book week at the Red Location Museum in New Brighton. The Bard has performed at the 2013 Nelson Mandela Bay Book fair that had the likes of Ntsiki Mazwai, Don Mattera, Lesego Rampolokeng, Niq Mhlongo, Motsoko Pheko, Ayanda Billie and other remarkable renowned authors and poets.
He has also co-founded NMMU's foremost spoken word and poetry society called the Resonance Poetry Movement, along with Sisonke Papu and Azola Dayile .ì which they have successfully managed to launch.
He has also worked with the NMMU International Office and the Centre for the Advancement of non-Racialism and Democracy (CANRAD) in the NMMU Africa Week in a public lecture delivered by Prof. James Ogude (University of Pretoria) in remembrance of the late Chinua Achebe and his impact on the African literature landscape. He has been featured as a one of the performers at the first ever two days poetry festival in the Nelson Mandela Bay: Praat Poetry Festival, which hosted Lebo Mashile and Lesego Rampolokeng as guest poets.
He is a regular performance poet at the Elements of Hip-hop sessions that are monthly held in Motherwell and at the Culture Consciousness weekly sessions. He was once headlined at the PE Opera House YiYo (An Opera house initiative that focuses on solo artists granting them a platform for discussion, performance and constructive criticism on their respective art forms.)
Every single person who claims to love poetry and is an art enthusiast is obliged to show respect to the craft of this young wordsmith as he continues to make major moves. He believes to be the embodiment and the rhetorical speaker for the neglected poor through his spoken word that he enthusiastically utters.",South Africa,"Since I am black
I am still knocking on closed doors
with broken handles
Begging for a small change
submitting thanks and praises
To God for nothing we got this far
Sounds strange
Like believing crime pays
When you benefit benefits for the day
To get by without having to buy by coins
Make a living of the daily ordinary don'ts'
By collecting all the bad points
Mobilize them
To get food into storage
Like food residues
We remain the rejects from the throne
Been blown
Thrown
Beaten by sticks and stones
Pistols and batons brought bruises
Broken backs and bones
Moans and groans
Were daily poems
However
We are still strong
Standing tall like a grandfather clock
Trying to live clean but they offer filthy jobs
To be done soon
Gave us goons
Took away the books
Like we are only good for hewing wood
And fetching water from the river
Rivers filled with filth and absolute filth
How could we possibly build firm homes
With sandstones
When you took away the flesh
And gave us dry bones?
Nowadays my streets and corridors
Are sprayed with a stunning graffiti
Called blood spills
My sisters are steelworks
They manufacture infants that are steel
Not still born but born to still stay stable
Steadfastly stand the storms with stances
That are stone strong.
Well according to my ancestral traces and traits, I am not a stranger to the planet dubbed blacks
Liable to preposterous attacks
Caused by the rugged rags
I rock bottom from top to bottom
That's how I blossomed from riches to rags
The tall story goes on. . .
Commenced by the veterans
Who voted for this freedom and democracy
You enthusiastically proclaim
Well this is not 76
I insist this is not 76
But in the streets
I am still rioting, boycotting prejudice
And skin colour bribery
Police brutality
Human rights violation
Public harassment callousness
Where is black consciousness?
When we are susceptible to reliance
Poor domestic servants and peasants
each year
we are there
to dare
voting for the black Verwoerds' and Malans're incarnated
Let's vote for the black Verwoerds' and Malans're incarnated.
We cannot just rest
we need a fresh installation disc
of black consciousness
my consciousness and conscience calls
what about yours?
My spirit sobs
When my time machine slide shows me
Of how blacks were taken to the dogs
They think it's nice to live a dog's life in a dog's house
Lost touch with much
Now
I only have poetry to spout!
Poetry of blacks!
Black concepts forsaken
This was taken
From the recycle bins of your daily trivialities
Of unspoken forbidden realities and mysteries
Of blacks who gradually dragged their
Identities &amp; histories into the deep gloomy
Rooms of non-existent western philosophies
From the cocky coons
Who casted their customs
For common commodities
My poetry is a photographic slideshow
That constantly
Play video tapes of unsung
Forgotten heroes
The tip of my tongue
Is a host for Sobukwe's and Biko's ghosts
Spitting tantrums
Like who the hell marked our
Traditions and cultures with dark spots
Like dominoes?
The question is intended to be rhetorical
But only if you view with one eye like a monocle
I hold the answers to ransom
until you open Your Third Eye vision
so envision what's missing. . ."

salty wetness
that defies growth
a soft light transformed a dark shell
into layers of brilliance
I didn't believe a pearl like you could grow
out of a girl like me, I gave you away to undeserving strangers
let their grimy fingers taint your splendour
let their lies trick you into believing
you had been fashioned in a dingy sweatshop
Made in China
bargained to the lowest bidder
it was me who scratched you
cut you
tried to stitch you up with twigs and dirty lace
left you out in the sun too long
I didn't believe a pearl like you could grow
out of a girl like me, I'm sorry

And every free rides that comes on rainy days
We would rise!
Above deaf ears with meaningful words
And poverty with meaningful faith, To all the sunrise in the world
And the beautiful songs that ease pains
We would rise
Above speculators
And loud cheers, To life's greatest gift of love
And man's strangest organ called mind
We would rise
To love and to hold
To care and to show, Let's throw up hands and bubble
Let's throw up strength and fix painful lashes
For we would rise
Above powers and principalities
Ogoni, we would rise!"
Vladmir Peter is a poet based in Dar es Salaaam Tanzania. ,Tanzania,"my mirror speaks of a reflection
as innocent as it's own judgement.
The inner sides it fails to mention,
would show a bloody mess if opened.
I torture what brings me pain,
and shelter what feeds me gain.
My eyes are not all white,
hence I see both coloured and black.
still, a stone that crushes blindly,
is your title for my poetry.
as if my will is what moves me,
when my deal is like yours, fully.
you have a god, we call fate.
one you feel, one I met.
you have wings and tamed birds,
I am the beast on my gates.
and just like you,
my chains, make me break.
only unlike you,
my demons, show my face."

so while you sleep, I roll myself next to you
feel the honey sticky of your cheek against mine
and get myself stuck.
Man!
if you weren't sleeping
you'd like it as much as i do then tell me
its an .òunsolicited violation of your personal space'
you won't mean this
by now I can predict your clouds
when you tell me you're dangerous
I have no reason to doubt this about you
you are a tired quilt of women,
a patch work of petrol fires that burn when you're awake in the absence of your father,
your hands remind me of home-the warm bed, my fathers distance.
you?
you remind me of no other lover
you don't do it on purpose, I like this.
so I give you a shelf , in a wardrobe of a flat im renting out
the vacant assurance
that you'll be here
tomorrow
i'm not stupid, i know we're not for keeps
still, I wish I was the only place you hung your shirts
I wish you'd stencil my hand over the aches,
I will always be here to
to plant healing with chicken soup
and handsome adjectives
and it will cost me nothing.
But you'd tell me that
breath like memory is not loyal
that tomorrow I could build myself a temple
on someones elses collar bone
write better poetry to sail there and worship there
Five times a day, with love as it is
hot then cold- it's in that 3am shiver
that our spines tell tales on us
of the lovers before
the teeth in their hands
the treasures they were given
and not given,
all the while carving stone shelters in the soft caves of backs
they would abandon when your laughter no longer brought out the stars for them
while you sleep
I catch the saxhorn growl in your chest
match its crescendo with mine
we make good music
This is where you belong.
you never say yes
never stay long enough to share the grocery bill with me
I bury myself with you anyway
you don't notice how deep.
Your lips, are red sirens littered with commas
I want so badly to hear them speak yes.
Instead knowing you are someone else's
I follow the fists your eyes make against your nightmares.
I think damn he must be a hero behind those brown doors."

Seething beyond freedom's zenithal bounds,

nearer I come
towards the vetkoek 						           with
too great and insatiable

to indulge
a fleeting sense					, The desire,

pirouettes

I have forgotten what it is
that is chasing me.
But I dare not stop!, Yes like the others
I will carry on running,
they say, if you stop,
you seize to be,
it catches you,
sinks its claws into you
and rips you apart,
there is no turning back,
so like the others I carry on running!, I am not afraid, never was to begin with,
curious yes, but not afraid because,
Pain I have seen and heard
but I have never felt,
never felt the sting,
never has the venom flowed deep within my veins,
paralyzing my soul,
never have I felt its blade
slice through my limbs or
gunshots tear through my flesh,
never have I felt hunger pangs rip through my insides.
Never been whipped till my black turned blue,
never been kicked and punched till my bones went snap!, I was lucky, I was shielded from the sadists
who craved my blood, they say my armor
is still shiny and new,
theirs have dents,
they have history,
they have life,
and they have character.
but I feel my case is worse off than theirs,
worse off than those that felt the pain!
I have scars, deep rooted scars.
Dedan Kimathi's cuffs dangle from my wrists,
Nyayo house whips tattooed on my back, generations
of tears burned into my skin! I have scars!
All they see is my shiny unscathed self
and a tongue too heavy to carry its mother tongue.
Words spoken like a drunken whore slurry
and unsure like a baby antelope.
How can my people say they protected me
when my mouth does not speak and my hears
do not hear what my ancestors say!
Gibberish! Gibberish all I speak is English.
Tell me, who is free?
Is it I the born free or
them that know who it is
and what it is we never stop running from,
never stop hiding from,
never stop fighting!!!, Is knowledge freedom or is freedom knowledge,
I have neither so what does that make me?
A rootless tree, without freedom of mind how can I be free,
without freedom of tongue how can I be free???
Look at me! Do I look free to you?
I am a prisoner of the worst kind,
a daughter of exile., A child born in prison on foreign land.
Chained and shackled by my own.
A child judged before I existed,
rejected by my government,
rejected by my people.
I fear everything,
I am afraid not of what I run from but of the one I run with,
I am not afraid coz I am not free, I am afraid coz I am not me!!
So when I arrive tell me, who will I be with if I am not with me!
I am the girl from nowhere who shall return from where she came!"

at the banquet,
Aristophanes announced
to minds that had gathered to speak of matters
of the heart.
In the beginning,
the human being had two faces,
four arms,
four legs
and two hearts.
God, in his infinite wrath
or eternal love,
separated the human being
and we,
in our current form,
were brought into existence
to forever search
for our other half., Occasionally,
twin souls find each other
and if you squint
at just the right angle,
a golden thread can be seen
knitting auras together,
fixing lives
that were ripped apart
too early in the makeup of time.
But hearts age,
change,
and two hearts
don't always remember
how to beat as one,
so irregular rhythm
has them beating
against each other
until they shatter., Do you remember
scratching in the dust
trying to find the pieces
of your heart?
Do you remember
sitting late
into the night
of your life,
trying to sew the shards
together with silver thread
that was almost
not strong enough
to hold dreams intact.
And now, you walk amidst strange
souls that have too many limbs,
with a tattered heart,
not quite sure
why your pulse
beats so different., Sometimes you have nightmares
of the gods ripping you in half
and your screams reach the sky
where a little girl
turns over stars
and strings them together
with silver,
looking for a constellation
that has her mother's face,
who left her
when she was still learning
to crawl
on the moon,
and though it hurts,
she searches and searches and searches,
because not all soul mates
are lovers., On rare nights,
she cries
and it rains
and her tears
land, salty on our skin
and remind us of our scars,
for we too
stand on the precipice
of this world
and fear falling
and cracking
like pottery,
because it hurts
and we can't always
find all the pieces
to put ourselves back together
again, once clumsy hands
have dropped us from the wall,
to the ground., There's no number of king's horses
and king's men
that can mend
a broken spirit,
but too many little girl's spirits
have been broken by men
pretending to be kings,
and now,
ripped sheets act as a barrier
as she wards off
Prince after Prince,
hiding her beauty,
for isn't that what gave her
these wounds in the first place?, These scars heal slowly
and sometimes they bleed,
but our blood is holy
and golden,
we are fragile but it is our resilience
which makes us beautiful.
These scars which mar our backs
Are the creases of flesh
from which
our silver tipped wings
are waiting to escape.
And it hurts
when feathers rip through skin,
when molten gold runs through scars,
when we are ripped apart
just so our heavy fingers can fumble at
pulling ourselves back together., But, if Aristophanes
could see us now,
he would announce to those minds
gathered to discuss matters
of the heart;
.òGentlemen, not even god could rip them apart.ù.
And I don't think
menders of pottery could full comprehend
the tenacity,
the beauty,
the resilience
of the lacquer of our scars,
because if they did,
they would have used our pain
instead of gold."

",South Africa,"Under my feet lie many graves
Across continents I've left a trail of death, and perfumed the world
with the stink of my breath
I have spoken aloud and silenced many
The sound of my voice came with a thunderous force
Parting your heavens, until your definition of God you lost
Now we stand in your presence stone and marble, cold and upright
For you to idol-
Worship me!
Bent on one knee
Fear me; I am a plague that travels by sea
Smooch my blistered lips and taste the philosophy of my saliva
Between my legs I warm civilizations; a lion's den
Where natives only escape as ghosts; shells of themselves
My kindness is shallow
My arms were not meant to embrace those whose minds are still infant.
My mission is to build walls around you and box you as primitive
My milk is toxic, my breasts have crippled nations
My ass is a veil, it hides your truth and steals visions from your prophets
My hand covers your mouth muzzling your speech
I have broken all your finger tips, you cannot reach
Purchased your ancestors' every bone, they were expensive slaves
That died before their time, now you must account as the deficit
Therefore amount to your worth, less of a human being
You shall forever be"

making you high on its tranquillity, come step into your healing pool."

",Zimbabwe,"today we'll rake again, all of us
around the base of a tree which bears fruit
only on its highest branch
we'll scrape beneath a scorching sun
that penetrates barren branches and scathed scalps
a people which suffer no other seasons but the fall
for the leaves fall, and they fall and they'll fall, there'll be no pips between our teeth
or trophy aches at day end, just dried leaves
so we'll build all manner of castle with peat
it's really no wonder we mourn excessively when we bury
just then, we question the blisters and arched backs
and we recall the mocking bird nestled at the tree top
daily singing as if to taunt wasted efforts
toil which occupies our everyday
but affords no gain for the next
inheritance, a legend from eternity past, but soon we jilt wit for belly, each to his tool
with tots and tunes to fill hollow dream chambers
once home to youthful desires
we rake, amassing dried leaves
no sooner are they gathered
than are they blown away by the slightest wind
so we'll rake in perpetuity
until the rake depletes our strength
and the spade burrows a mouth in the earth
for the tree to make meal our shrivelled remains
we then are dried leaves too, leaves for the raking
and those who remain will mourn excessively as we're laid
just then, they'll abhor the blisters and arched backs
till dusk, when tomorrow beckons today
and today, today we'll rake again"

(The spoken word and hip-hop event hosted by Magamba), House of Hunger Poetry Slam South Africa, The Experience (nu-verb), Poetry and Music (part of the poetry and.¶ series).",Zimbabwe,"I have been to a place where the corn is always ripe
But the fields are never open
Where governments have built systems on luciferian doctrine
It's a place where Zion enjoys intercourse with Babylon, It's a place like Sodom, philosophy built on street wisdom
Get the money then the kingdom
A place where children are birthed and never fathered
Here people sharpen gifts and not character
Don't judge me by the words I have spoken
It's just a place I have been, Here I have seen leaders walking and followers running
It's a place where many follow signs and very few follow substance
A place where bread never becomes substance for the eater
And the so-called mature cannot feed on bones
Here truth is married to tradition and the children are fathered by traditional, Don't get me twisted I don't hate this place because I was saved from it
So judge me not by the words I have spoken
It's just a place I have been"

It is ugly
but it is ours,
Do not hold on to lies
That you were fed when you were young.
Learn the history of your people
Find the truth
to free your soul from evil
Learn the Qur-an
Learn the bible
Find the meaning of life and religion.
Do not fear the past.
It is painful
but it is real
Blood was spilt and people died
but love and unity had survived.
Learn the tongue of your ancestors
Reconnect with the roots of your blood
Find the knowledge
That was stolen
Find the life that was robbed from us.
Do not fear the past.
Embrace it
Let it teach you the wisdom of your race
Take its lessons and live by them
Own the identity that was erased.
Do not fear the past,
Do not hate it.
Do not fear the past,
Learn about it.
Let it teach you
Let it nurture you
Let it remind you, of who you are"

,South Africa,"Through the neck. On the back
of the back. Bent, bullied, boasted.
Stood. Slept against coir: its lumps.
Bones have stood vertical and held.
Held up. Tall. Hard. Bridges. To the
top of the day. The days. Every day.
Up. Upright. Arrow-browed. Gaunt
bridges: up of the plunging up.
Shouldering bones. Shouldering trees.
Shouldering progeny, storm-sodden
ewes. Raising. Lofted sheds. Planted
poles going high. Roofs lifting to a
pitch. Crops tall as cane. Thatch
streaked by season. Straight and dry.
Trees slowly. All over. Eucalypts. White
shanks into the cloud. Clouds on stalks.
Blood. Litmus of rising days. Sapgreen
insect juices into the up. Up. Standing.
Long cheekbones. Lean. Sculpts. Tall.
Tall hands. Nostril bones. Tall and
aquiline. Foreheads: Forefathers.
Coursing. Coursing. Bone."

,Zimbabwe,"They still drew the old roller over the cricket pitches with men
yoked like a team of oxen to the stubborn iron wheel.
The grass smelt as the grass did, all rich beneath the afternoon sun .ì
the heat flashing to the ground with a blinding flick of steel.
All the fields were there .ì but much smaller than remembered .ì
the rugby and football grounds unused, the whitewashed lines
washed out by the rains, but the names of dead Jesuits, on signs,
still stood on the preened edges .ì in traditional white and red.
Up into view the memorable tower of stone rose with all the dreams
of climbing up the winding cool stairwell, up to the top of the turret
where thoughts of fields, soft with breaths of Natal grass, met
the sky with hope and refuge. But those were just a schoolboy's dreams
brought on by the sight of the huge bronze plaque of St. George
plunging his spear, extinguishing our fears of the dragon.
Though all that bullshit vanished with age, the staged hero on the forged plaque still remained some old myth the Jesuits liked to work on.
.òI'm here to go through the Chronicles.' .ù86 to the mid 90's.'
The receptionist is grey and half-deaf, I'm apparently soft spoken .ì
so there's a lot of repetition accompanied by grimaces and apologies.
.òI'm here to go through the Chronicles.' .òYes', to another question,
.òI did attend here some years back.' .òYes, an Old Georgian, an old boy.'
The phone slowly goes up to her ear as she mentions something
about visits and strange requests from foreign journalists wanting
to sit in on classes or have private interviews with the boys.
.òPenny?' .òYes, Penny it's me'. .òI seem to have a safe one here.'
.òWants to go through the Chronicles.' .òSomething about poetry.'
Her small eyes look up. .òYou do remember the way to the library?'
I had forgotten, but then retrace the steps in my mind to get there.
Each class I pass, a voice spills from the mock-Edwardian windows,
the red polished floors tap under my feet, and a sweet blessedness
fills me that I'm not sat in those sweat-rooms of learning, shadows
of my youth, daydreaming about a new-world after the first kiss.
The study-hall has lost all its desks and holds an array of instruments
and chairs for classical musicians. The fountain in the quad is gone now, and at first it didn't mean a thing to me .ì but then a crude bewilderment took hold when a memory tried to find its place in the absence; and how on earth they removed it had me lost .ì the lawn was perfectly smooth. The weights' room, where our hands were beaten blue by a leather wad, where iron was pumped on hot afternoons, was now clean and had the smell of sweat and leather replaced by veneered internet booths.
Outside an office a boy lifted his hat and said .òGood morning' in a way
that had me question what he'd said. It was only when I looked back
that I noticed the strain on his face, his rheumy eyes and the big black
words scoured across his chest, FAGGOT. I could see how easily they
could have pinned him down. The tree was there where we sat at break
trying to forget the colour bar that still hasn't faded outside the gates;
the smell of musasa leaves and old orange peels revived a dead ache
that filled my belly: a mob outside the science-labs, fists of other kids.¶
When I met Penny she smiled, and something told me it wasn't a strange request to come here and go through the Chronicles. She had them stacked up on her desk, all piled up chronologically .ì towers of memories, names and dates in black and white at my disposal. I sat down, leafed through the pages, the photographs alive in my head; and after an hour of being immersed in the vivid quiet, the bell rang: It was still that same high-pitched drill that once brought relief as it sang through the long corridors, but with it also came a certain dread."
